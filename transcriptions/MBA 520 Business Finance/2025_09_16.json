  "text": "questions. So you get 10 and 10. They set them back here at the end of class and you can pick it up at the end of class. So the capital is going to study from over a sea of whatever. Later this afternoon on canvas I will post the solutions to the problem set. It will be right there where the problem set at the second end. So we're going to go back to the same thing and you'll see a problem in the final solutions that will show up. So you can see what my solution would have been if you were not sure. Okay. How was the problem set? Super hard to bring easy to some of the middle. Really fun. The first two questions were something hard in the last question. In the war, questions are in the main question. In the main question. Okay. Not the war, but that's how it would be where he's in. Okay. So you're going to get a hard feeling possible? No, it's possible. Okay. Just like, actually we're going to have to do that for a while. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I can do it. No, you do it right out. You've related this question. How related are the difficult to problem set to the beginning of the present one? Yeah. How difficult exam questions are compared to the rest of the problem sets? I'd say that the exams have a pretty good variety. Like you'll have kind of beginner through like very advanced. And what were the things? These were like beginner to middle, I would say personally. Let me clarify that. If I was a music, I would say, you do not have to use log. And so there is a way, if you want to learn the way you can come learn. But there is a way, so you should never have to do log. Which in my opinion is what makes it hard. Yeah, it's easy to log. It didn't take so long. You can solve for tea. And you can tell you do all the time, it's better to yourself. I did like to show you how it's grown. Oh, I see. I don't know what it looked like. That's normal at the book. I think I would say, look, like I said before in class, but I'll just reiterate it in case it doesn't make sense. I'm fighting for music cells on the problem set. I just want you to know what formula you're using and how to settle a cell in through that. So I, like on that question, I'm totally fighting for just using cell for tea rather than taking a bunch of log of stuff. Or not, there's the log of stuff. As long as you know what that equation is doing and what it sells doing, which is basically guessing check until it finds one of those groups that you don't like a match is the equation. So you want to say that? Do you think? Do you know what I mean? That's? Yeah. But because we don't have cell exam, then we do use one. I mean, now I'm not going to ask you to solve it, the question like that. Oh, well I think it. I'm not going to ask you to take the root of anything. I'm not going to ask you to take the n-th root of something. Yeah, you're welcome. This is very, it feels very much like Stockholm syndrome. You guys are plotting me for not after I put you through something terrible. I'm just going to have a little bit of that. That's a lot of fun. That was like an major question. You can let me know how to do that. It sounds like a real thing. Not really. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Other questions about the problem you said? Okay. Awesome. Perfect. So in terms of other announcements, let's see here. The problem set ones do today. Your next assignment is the World Com case. That's set to for 30th. So that is what? Two weeks. Yeah, two weeks from today. So just heads up on that. And then there's the problems that you do the next class after that. It gets a little bit hairier there for the next few days. So like plan accordingly. Keep your eye on the schedule. We got World Com case September 30th. Probably set two arc tours. Second. Hines case arc tour. So it's sort of a creative role. Yeah. That's pretty much it. We're cruising along. Yeah. You can't say people have questions. Are you doing? I'm good. I'm doing really well. Yeah. I had awesome conferences. I had some part of it. You guys have played a good slide break for me on Thursday. Yeah. It's great. Things are good. So I got to say, do you learn? Let's learn. Here's what I want to do. Let's do a little example of pricing a bond. This is what you're going to have to do on a case. And I just want to use it to kind of reinforce what stuff you learn in the problem set. And then we're going to start talking about race and what we need better. But let's do a quick little example of pricing a bond. So I'm literally just making the numbers out of half the flex. So I'm not going to notice it. You guys are going to come with answers. Let's see what we have upon. And it's got three years left in our cello and insurance. Now, here's a little terminology. The bond is going to have what's called a coupon. You guys know what a coupon is? I'm sure someone knows what a coupon is. It's like the annual interest payment. Yeah. It's the interest rate on the bond. But it's what's written on the contract when they issued the bond. So this bond might be seven years old already. It was issued seven years. It's a 10-year bond. It was issued seven years ago. There's two years left until it's issued. That makes sense. And when they issued it, they're going to say here's what the coupon is. And let's say this bond was issued seven years ago. Now, seven years ago, we're interest rates higher or lower than they are right now. They were lower. They were lower, right? So let's say if you've got a coupon of only five percent. So this company issued this bond with the coupon of five percent, which at the time was a correct sort of market rate for this bond. But since that time, interest rates have gone up. Why interest rates gone up? Because inflation, right? Just like we talked about last time, we've got this little model of the required rate or return for anything, which is the risk rate plus the risk rate. It's about risk on the bond. That risk rate has inflation in it. And because inflation's gone up, that drives up the interest rate on the bonds. So the current, what is called the yield to maturity of the bond, let's say that's seven percent. So yield to maturity is like what the market charges for this bond right now. It's the current market rate for the bond. Okay? Special is good. So what I want to do is like, let's just map out the cash flows of this bond. Okay? So in time period one, if I own this bond in time period one, what am I going to get? 50. 50 dollars. And tell me how you get that, Amon. Well, usually bonds are actually at a thousand. So you take a thousand times the coupon percentage. So it's a thousand times five percent or fifty dollars. Exactly. So in your one, I've got a thousand dollar bond, which is the typical face value of one. And I get five percent of that. I'm going to get 50 bucks. So next year, if I own this bond, I'm going to get 50 bucks. Yeah. Do all of this in one thousand for bonds? Yes. The pretty much always issued in thousand dollar agreements. Now, here's the stupid thing about bond. People usually quote them in hundreds. Why? Because we like to make things difficult. So you'll see, you'll look up the price on the bond and you'll see the price is a hundred and five. What they actually mean is that thousand fifty. Stop. Stop. Wait. Yeah. Why? Why? Because we want to keep bond traders in particular, actually. No, it is like, you can protect them. They do some of the other things that you can do. You can do it in eights instead of like, present day. You should do it all three. You can do it all three. You can do it all three. You can do it all three. You can do it all three. You can do it all three. My dad treated bond growth for years. I still don't know why they do things. I'm not going to get that. Okay. So we'll get back to that price thing in just a second. Actually, I'll put it back in. Okay. But this is the actual cash flow. Actually, only the bond we're actually getting is fifty bucks. Okay? What about it in your two? Fifty. Fifty bucks? This is assuming they don't default. They default and that's a different story. Let's assume it's not going to stay out. Okay. What about it in your three? I'm going to get fifty. But that's also in the bond with shirts. And bonds usually pay off. They're not advertising. They pay off in bullet paint. So I'm going to get fifty plus a thousand. So bullet paint just means I'm getting only interest. And then at the end I get all my principal debt. Okay. All good? So if you have a bond you are actually receiving the back type of debt every year. Yes. So we have like a over that. I am assuming that with a bond over that could probably like pay the grant and return the bond. It's going to be a good one. It's going to be a good one. Now I just don't know how to spell it. No. No. The coupon literally means the company is going to pay interest every year. They're not going to pay off any of the principal. They'll pay off all the principal debt at the very end. But you already know the interest here. So the $50 is kind of like a dividend on a bond. Yeah, exactly. Or it's like the interest payment that I'm getting from a low-cost bond. Exactly. Very good. This is just a semantic question. But the year is one, two, and three. That's actually the 8, 9, 10, right? Yeah, yeah. So I'm always, that I'm really glad to put about this. I will always use the conventions that right now is year zero. Okay. And so this is next year year one, but you're right in terms of the bond, that's year eight of the bond. Yeah, exactly. But right now is year zero. And that's year one. Yeah. Very good. Of course. So the real-time maturity right now is going to in one second. Yeah, we're just not there yet. Not so far though, right? Like this is actually an interesting point. The coupon is what the coupon is. That's what the construct says. It doesn't matter that the ultimate maturity is 7%. The company's not like, oh, we're going to be nice and like pay extra. No, they're going to pay what the coupon says. They're paying the 50-50-50. Regardless of what you want to see. But this is still going to matter. And that's where we're headed right now. Okay. Awesome. Great question. Other question needs to be mentioned. Okay, so now you guys tell me what is the present value of this bond? How do I go out figuring that out? Sorry, is this still going to be a zero? And now we're at your three with them. No, the present value, so you're zero. So the real-time. Yeah. If I wanted to go out and buy this bond or sell this bond, what's it worth? What do I have? I've got a stream of future cash flows. And what do I want to do with that? With the sum of your future values discounted by... I want to discount a back to present value and add them up? Exactly. So I need to do some kind of equation. Let's get a little coin this. And in this case, what does that look like? What's my here one cash flow? 50. And then you need to discount that. Here's where the ultimate surety comes in. This is the actual market rate for this bond. So this is the actual discount rate that I need to use. Because the market's telling me this represents my expectations for inflation over the next three years. So I need to use the actual current market rate to discount this bond. So this is going to be one plus zero.07 to discount that. You're two. You're two. You're 50. If I divide by it, I'm just going to do 1.07. I'm adding those together squared. And then your three is going to be 1.07. If I divide by 1.07, cute. That's supposed to be a three. That made it not like that. Now, don't do any math just yet. Although I do want you to do the math with the answer. But before you do any math, is this present value going to be more or less than $1,000? Less. Why less? I mean, we're just counting it 5.07. 7% has more than what we wanted. Yeah. So it makes sense to get that 7% return. So how do we pay how? But how do we less than that? Exactly. This bond is returning 5%. But I'm discounting it 7%. So it's not worth $1,000 anymore. It used to be worth $1,000 when I first issued it. But think about it. If you're out there trading in this market, and you find a bond that's yielding 5%, that the market rate is 7%. Do you want to buy that bond? Not really. And so therefore you don't. And what happens to the price of the bond? It goes down. And it's going to go down until we get to a point where I'm happy to buy it. That's how I know that price is going to be less than $1,000. Because that price is going to go down because the interest rate is going up. So one thing, like a good kind of rule of thumb to have in mind, is any time interest rates go up, the price of financial interest rates go down. The price of financial interest rates go down. The price of financial interest rates go up. That just tends to be true. Okay. So, is there another calculation? What do we got? $947.50. $947.50. So this, if markets are functioning correctly, this should be the price of that bond. If I want to go out there and buy it, I should be able to buy it for $947.50. Okay. And the cool thing is that buy it for $947.50. It's $51.50. But I still get interest on the $1,000.00. And I still get repaid to $1,000 at the end. So if I buy this for $947.50, and I hope to make sure it eats, what rate of return am I going to get? Who said that? Joseph? Seven percent. How do you know that? That's the rate used this counter. Exactly. Just backing out exactly where I... That's how I found this number. As I said, I need to get at least a seven percent return. And therefore the price is going to fall until I get a seven percent return. Because that's what the market demands. So why would the yield to return a seven percent return? So it's going to be dictated by these two things. And in the little scenario I set up, it's like, let's imagine it's just because inflation has come up. And so therefore, might at $1,050 in the future is not worth as much. And so the price who is down today, because I need at least a seven percent return to keep up with inflation. But it's actually both of these things. Great question. Now. Isn't this essentially why it's so compelling to be failed? Because they had a lot of the bond that had lower rate, right when it's turning up, so that the value of their bond was steeped. Yeah. Basically they made a bet that interest rates weren't pointed out, but they were not. And they lost that bet. Big lead. And that was not good. Okay. Yeah. Bonny. So in this instance, what was the only yield that was shorting going in the same rate that was also a few years, right? So some of the best that it's a, a reasonable action goal that you could possibly have. And through so many meetings, I spent our, I tried to value that deal with the bubble. That's right. So this seven percent return reflects the market's expectation to hold with the next few years. So it could be that the market expects, you know, suppose this seven percent return has like, you know, three percent interest rates. It actually could be that the market expects four percent inflation next year. And then, by the under three percent of the next two years, and this is like the weighted average of that interest rate. So I'm going to use the same seven percent every single year always. So that reflects my expectations over that horizon. And it's kind of adjusting to that. Yeah. Do your way of practice is signed without adding every single year? Not really. No. There is, so if it was, this would be it like a great reference from last class, what if it had this bond had no end date? It's just $50 every year for forever. There's no maturity. By the way, the UK government has issued these tax bonds. So you would do the cash flow divided by the rate? Yes, exactly. So if it was in perpetuity, that the present value would be $50. I get that every single year divided by 0.07. And that's that cash flow divided by our formula that we talked about briefly last class. So that would be a short cut. But only if it's in perpetuity. It's not in perpetuity. You got to do it this way. And this is what we're going to talk about. For example, there's going to be like the limited number of years then. Exactly. So in the exam, I'm not going to make you do 15 years. Think of it. We're going to do three or four, and then we're going to call it it. Exactly. It's the last payment, what is $50,000? $50,000? Yes. You could use like the new formula. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. How does this, hope you're going to be populated, how does that, how does that, or does this formula come from? It's, this is like, it can be really fast, and you don't have to know where this comes from. But I'll show you, just because I love you. I'm good. Ah. I can't. I can't. Okay. This is my generic formula. But if I have the same cash flow in every single period, always, then I can rewrite this formula this way. Cash flow, times, this sum. Oh, that's an infinity variable. Right? I can just faster out that cash flow. Because that's the same one in every single period. And it turns out, this sum, is a geometric series that collapses to one over r. That's just a math fact. There's no ethnogins wishing, but this is why we love math conditions, because I figure out stuff like this for us, and it gets us this really simple math. That's a guess. No, that's not it. No, except, kind of. Yeah. Can you Google it, or you can use it? I tried. I'm going to use it. You'll have to hit it. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, then, here's the very very last thing. This is where I apologize on behalf of all of our traders. They would write this price this way, $94.75. Yes. So, take it. I'm sorry. I was making it. It's not going to be the answer. You figure it out, maybe you know how to make five. That's one of the blessings I can make. Do you need to write it like that on the math, how we would do it for a phone? On the exam, I'll make it very clear, where you're supposed to do it. I don't know what I'll... I haven't decided what I'm going to ask you yet, but I'll make sure. You decide. Like you need today. So, even though they write it like $94.75, when you actually buy it, would you still pay the 51, even though that's not written in there? Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Does that one have any questions? No, we're getting... First. Sweet. You know what I guess? Okay, so I thought it might just be helpful. I wrote the math example together, that hopefully it'll clarify things, look at how we use this stuff to... Before we get, we're going to get theoretical again now. But I want to do one practical thing for you. So, is that really... That's how law work every time, is you just get pay the interest every year, and so maturity, and that is due to interest plus full principal, or is that like a specific? That is how almost all bonds work. Okay. There's every flavor of bond you can imagine, and so, no, not every time. But most bonds, this is how they work. And you should assume that they're up on work, unless I tell you something different. I assume that this is how long it will take. This is like a plain vanilla standard one, that I'm trying to... That'd be best. Yeah. But the yield maturity, that's a number that's set as part of the bond agreement, that's just adding it in a moment of time, this is the market. That's exactly right. The market in terms of... And I have no control over this number. So, just whatever your calculating present value, look it up, and that's really easy. Yes, and the problem is, sometimes I can't look it up, and that's where we have to go to this, and that's what the rest of class today, all the time, and then, for the next couple of weeks, is going to be about how you figure this thing out. But sometimes you can just look it up, and that's what you're going to do. Just go look it up. Yeah. It's something that we're going to do. It's about to turn to do this. Just go in my head. Yes. That's seven and four. Uh-huh. There you go. Yes. Does that then in terms of, because it's not lower than what's being paid, it means it's actually not up in value. Exactly. Yeah. So, if this seven was a four, but a four year, this is going to be over a set of shocks. Because everyone loves this one, right? It's yielding five percent, when the current going market is only four percent. So, I want to buy that thing. I mean, I buy it, I'm going to push the price up until what? You didn't tell the seller. Until it yields four percent. Yeah. And that's when I stop buying it, and that's where the price becomes like a fair market value. That's it? Yeah. So, who would be selling this? I mean, do these people try to look at what A1 cash now? Or why would I sell it if I have four dollars? Yeah. You don't have more value. So, if it was four percent and it's theoretically above market rate. Yeah. So, why would I sell it? Why would I sell it if the price is a thousand thirty five? Lots of reasons. Maybe it's just like I need cash for something else. Should be just like lucrative unions. That's probably the most common. But it could also be, look at the market says the current rate is four percent. But I actually kind of think the rate should be five percent. And so, it's overpriced relative to me. And so, I'm going to sell now because I expect prices to go down. I'm going to sell high, trying to buy a little. So, there are people out there, this is what investor managers are doing. Because they're trying to identify mispriceings. And they try to buy one as low and sell them as high. But of course, the other person on the other side is buying. Because they probably think that prices can go up. And this is like how the market aggregates on the information. No, exactly. Okay. Cool. That's the end of my example. Hopefully that's a little bit helpful. Now we're going to jump back to this equation. Do you have a case better, is this? Okay. Okay. Take good notes. Okay. So, here's our model. This is kind of where we ended last night. And the risk to be ready for typically getting used like a treasury bond or a teapil, which is a short term treasury bond, which is a note for this risk to be ready. How do I choose the maturity of that risk to be ready? Come on. Take a seat. Here, but just get a matter. Let's say for the last attempt I'm just doing, that bond had three years left of this maturity. So, what risk to be ready for I want to use? Three years risk to be ready. So, whatever the cash flows are that I'm doing, I want to match the maturity of the risk to be ready to the maturity of the cash flows. If I'm valuing a 10-year project, I want a 10-year bond. If I value it to your project, I want a 2-year bond. What if my project never ends? What if I'm valuing Disney? When I have an end date for Disney? What risk to be ready to I want to use? The 30. I would like it in perpetuity. So, I'd like to go and beg the government say, please issue a perpetual bond for me. So, then I know what risk to be ready is. And they say, sorry, it's the longest. So, what are we going to do? We're going to do the next best thing. What can we do? We did the longest we can get. Typically, people either use the 10-year or the 30-year. There's an argument either way. I don't care a lot. I will tell you on an example which one to use. In general, though, you want to go about the longest you can get. But in a market that's still liquid, the price reflects like true market conditions. So, if I value something really long term, I want to go at least 10 years. If I can, I'm going to 30-year bond and grab the 30-year bond. So, that's every flight inflation exchange rate, but there's 30 years, which is like as good as we can get. Does that sound good, everybody? All right. So, that's this bit. That part's pretty easy. Now, we're going to do the hard bit, which is risk. What I say to work risk? What do I like jumps to your mind? That word gain. A court gain. Yes, the court gain risk? Okay? Get it? What else? Yeah. Uncertainty? Okay? Court of volatility. Potentials? Potentials? Tell me more about what do you mean potentials? I mean, it's like how we talked about it in other caloric fields. Like, quite a time we played to lose with it more than we did with it risk. But, you can lose, but you can also win so much more. Yeah. So, possibility. Yeah. Very good. Brad. Probability. Probability? Good. Great insurance. Insurance? Right? I want to hedge against some of that risk. Very good. Anything else? Yeah. Well, political risk. Political risk? The color of the risk or market risk? Okay, yeah. So, you think of like different types of risk, but I can start to categorize these things into different areas. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay? Quancy? The prison is dilemma. Prisoner is dilemma? You can't tell how many you can't sue me. Yeah. My mind is that there's a game of trade-offs and you need to be able to play that. Okay? Fair. Fair? Yep. So, here's the thing that I want to, I'm going to have to drive this home and I'm going to travel from lots of times. The problem with the English language at least is we're not very precise when we talk about risk. And a lot of times when people say, oh, that's risky, what they mean is low probability of success. That's not what I mean ever in finance. Finance is not that in risky finance is not about the probability of success. Risk is about the variance, which I think is what Alex said. Well, I'm telling you simply, that's what it means. Yeah, exactly. So, that's really important. Like, write that down. Risk is not about the probability of success. Risk is about the variance or the uncertainty. So, when I say risk, you think variance. Always. Okay? Always, always, always. Yeah, Jacob. I think I'm not necessarily using that as just conventional in finance to say risk. Yeah, it's pretty much just like an engineering. They would turn on the certainty to describe that. I mean, in academic finance, we're going to use... We're going to just write that, and that'd be all below the D. But the problem is the most returnal doesn't like D. The most returnal likes to say things in conventional language, and that's why risk is... That was a serious way. I mean, we're going to be ready. I'm like, I'm just going to be an institution. Okay. So, which of these two distributions is risk here? This is the most returnal. This is the most returnal. Hello? B-file? The black one. The black one, why? Because that's a further distribution, so that's variance. Exactly. So, this one's got a lower expected value. It's got a lower probability of success. The blue one does, but there's very little variance around it. So, it's not risky. I know what's going to be correct. It's not risky. It's just bad. The black one is very risky. It's got high variance. I could end up over here. I could end up over there. It's very spread out. So, it's got high variance. I'm like, I was just writing. You've ever had a spask class. A lot of time to read variance. I started out my little small. It was like a sigma squared. But all about the sigma squared. It's not about the new, which is the expected value of the distribution. You're not going to have to use these symbols that much in my class. But I'm putting them up here just to make connections if you've had spask class. It's not about the new, it's about the sigma squared. It's not about the mean, it's about the variance. That's what risk is all about. Okay? Now, do we like risk? No, we don't like risk. We hate risk. We want to get rid of risk. But, you know, we do like, we like returns. And it just so happens that they always go ahead and ahead. Which is why all of you are like, yeah, I got like risk. That's because you've already associated it in your brain with higher returns. The possibilities like Caroline was saying, right? I can't get high returns without taking on some risk. I hate the risk. If I can get a sure thing, that's even better. But in practice, that's just not how markets work. If you want to return, you've got to take on some risk. And those two things just always go ahead. And I want to demonstrate that right now. By imagining we're playing, dealer no deal. Probably not everyone's familiar with dealer no deal. So, in case you're not, let me just briefly briefly explain to others first. The dealer no deal is this like a show where there are a bunch of brief cases up front. And you knew what values were in the brief cases, but you didn't know what values they wish briefcase had, which value. And the contestant picks one briefcase out of that, what were they? 26, thank you. Clearly I didn't actually watch the game. But I know how it works, probably. But pick one, there's 25 left up there. And they'll slowly start eliminating them, showing the values that are in there. And as you see the values, you get to learn a little bit more about what's in your briefcase. So, here's the thing, imagine you're playing dealer no deal. You're holding one briefcase, and there's only one other one left, because they don't want to keep this one. And I also want to make this really fun. So, there's two values left. What are the most fun two values? One dollar. There is that one. Is there a one set for you? There is a one set. One set? It's a dollar. There's two briefcase left. You don't know which one you're holding. Once you've got a million dollars in it, once you've got one set in it. This is a very risky bet, right? High variance between the two possible outcomes. 50-50, which one do we have? Now, the thing that's interesting about dealer no deal is that they've got this person, the baker. The baker's the shadowy figure up in the corner. They call you up, and they offer you a deal, right? And the deal is I will pay you X amount of dollars for your briefcase. And you walk away with that money for sure, and you give up the chance of a million, but you also give up the risk of one set. So, I want you to imagine to yourselves what deal, what number is the minimum you would accept from the banker? If you're holding a briefcase, and these are the two values that are left, what number would you accept from the banker? If they call you up, if they said 200,000 would you accept it? If they said 300, if they said 500, you know, whatever number. So, think that yourself, and you give you 10 seconds to evaluate, do a little gut check. Okay? Yes, got your numbers? I got them. Are we ready? Okay. I've got some obstacles that you can't decide. I just can't get some numbers here. This is the lowest stress. Cory, what's your number? 500 grand. 500 grand. Right. Yeah, it's like the value of it. Right in the middle of it. 500 grand? Let's get a few others here, who have I got? Ammon. 250. You want it before? I want to be a 250k one-job. Tiffany. I can actually buy this. There we are. Did you take the first one? Actually, also 500k. 500k? No. We got two of those for 500. That's over. Okay? Cash. And I want to choose. Anna? What's your number? I said 350. 350? I'm just kidding. Let's get a few more up here. John. John's in here. That's you. 500,000 and half of one set. That is garbage. Oh, it's coming from here. It's not material. If someone gives me 400 grand in cash, I'm just trying to go to my kids. In ones. Yeah. So you have a hard drive probably going through 350? 350? I don't want to sign it. Is he? 350. 350? Two of them. Let's go, is he? Okay, we'll just grab a couple more here. Let's see here. J's. J's. Yeah. I said 450. 450, okay? Two of them. What did you just do? Two of them. Jared? It's 400. 100. We're right here. 100. Okay. I respect that one. 100. 100. 100. Yes. 100,000. I did mean 100. I did mean 100. Last one. Corbin? Corbin. Right here. Greg Corbin? I don't know. 3, 6, 7. I'm putting in the 350. Okay? Okay. Now, just to get a better sense of the room, everyone put your hands up. And when I say a number that's higher than what you would go, put your hand down. I just want to get a sense of where I hit half the room. Okay? I'm sorry. All right. So, 50,000. It was anyway 50. What? It was somebody's 50. Okay. 100,000. 150. 200. 250. I think we're close to half. 300. I'm going to say 300. So, I have. Okay? Is there anyone that goes half of them? I don't know. I don't know. John, John, I'm sitting there. I got you. Yeah. What's your number, Jorge? 9 or 9. What? 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7... Where does it take? $2. James. $750. Okay. So, we have a few 7,000. I don't want to cut the 9 or 9,000. I'm going to cut it. $9. That's a sold-out. I'm going to cut it. That's a sold-out. What does that mean? $2. What gets you guys in a second. Okay. That's wild. But most of you are kind of, you know, in this range, a 300,000 from the average of the class. Why less than 500,000? 500,000 is expected value, right? We'll go to that. Why less, Amin? I think it's because the pain of losing the money is more painful than like the joy of winning it. Mm. You got a little loss of versions. Yeah. Right, yeah. I agree. Yeah, Brad. To expand on the difference between one cent and 300,000 is a lot greater than the difference between 300,000 and a million in terms of what, like, it means for you or your family right now. Yeah. If you had economics, what Brad does the express was diminishing marginal utility, right? Which is, the first $300,000 is more to be for the next $300,000. Or even maybe more than the next $700,000. Because I can do a lot with 300,000 and it's really, really painful to lose that, right? Monty, so much more points out of just risk a version, right? Like, we are typically far more willing to take a smaller amount that is in our hand than the chance of something bigger, right? But for example, one of the hand is worth to a flush down here. Yeah, exactly. So really what you guys are telling me is you dislike risk, except for a few of you. We'll get to you in a second. OK? You guys dislike risk. In fact, if I flip this on its head a little bit, you have to get paid an extra $200,000 in expectation to take this risky bet. This 300,000 is your certainty equivalent of a $500,000 expected value risky bet. Does that make sense? Do I need to say that again? Yes. So your about half the class was around the $300,000. And what you're telling me is $300,000 is equivalence to you. You're just indifferent between having $300,000 for sure and a risky bet was an expected value of $500,000. And so to take on the risk, I need $200,000 in expected value to induce me to switch from the certain thing to the risky thing. Does that make sense? You have to give me a higher return to take on that risk. Higher expected returns to take on that risk. That's exactly what we mean by risk and return to go ahead and hint. You've got to hint anymore. Otherwise, I'm never going to invest in that bet. And that's what the banker is playing off of. And that's why the banker is calling up and offering you something lower than $500,000. Now, what the heck is going on with the $200,000 is that those of you that are here, you guys want to answer for yourselves? I will. Add. Now, what I heard about this every time I've got you in the show. Because she would take the $300,000. I would not. The reason for me is that either way, I'm leaving with more money than I came. I didn't put any money in. If it would be very different, if I had to somehow buy into this situation, and I was actually losing money, I don't do this. I see the counter argument. I don't view that as losing $700,000. I do this as the opportunity to win a million. And so it's not. I don't own it. It's not mine. I guess, and I also have that typically much higher just to tell my ex than you. But that's how I view it. That's my argument to my wife every time. I'm like, yeah, but the $300,000. Right, but the million, like, you're there to leave with some money. And yeah, it's such a good thing. But you try. That's the way I see it. So what if you had four briefcases left, and it was like $1.5, $0.10, $0.50, $1 million? And it was like $200,000. Yeah, yeah, now it's something's changed, for sure. And that's an area. Because knowing the game show, I have to continue opening briefcases, so that would change. If it came down to two, if it's just between, yeah, in this scenario. Yeah, it's gotta be, it's gotta be, you have a million dollars. And it's typically, I also, I love games shows like this. There's also doing our games. I think where it was very different style and the dollar values were way up. But they had this game where the offers were much more like ground numbers than in the game show, where it's like down to, and there's probably a whole other of them doing in the game show. No, it's a pancreas, sure. And yeah. And yeah, I don't even know how he answered it. I don't know. There were a lot of scenarios in that show where it was like an offer, basically, the people who could figure it out, I need to play this until my offer is higher than more than half of the cases for me. Yeah. And so then you take it because you're now playing the odds. If I were given two scenarios, two options like this, I'm rolling the dice. I'm thinking it's a one-to-one life, I'm not playing. Okay. All right. Let's see, who was that? 900, was that all right? Okay. A similar answer, a different answer. Yeah. Yeah, just because of like, they didn't have to start with one eye, like, I could have this, you know, thinking more than me, I'm gonna have to go get a job. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so here's the thing. There's no right or wrong answers with your number, right? Like, I'm just asking you what your preference is. All we're saying in finances, in general, your average investor is risk averse. And so you end up seeing markets doing something like this. That doesn't mean there isn't the random, like, straightened person. Love's rich. This is risk loving, by the way. Anything above 500,000 is risk loving, not risk averse. It means I actually would take less expected value in order to take on the risk than the certainty you'd quote, right? Like, if I'm at 900,000, I'm actually losing $400 in expected value to take on the risk. So, instead of you paying me to take on risk, I'm paying you to take on risk. Feels like people are gonna go to Vegas a little bit, right? There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean there's something broken. It just means that on average, people really are risked. Yeah. I'm sorry. Unless there's this so expected value, is that just like the middle point? Yes. These are 55. No, it's a peak in there. Not exactly the peak, but if you take the probability of every single one of these possible outcomes, and you sort of wait that probability by the value at that outcome and you add them up, you're gonna get a funny, funny value. If it's a, like, basically moral distribution like this, it is gonna be basically the peak. This distribution is very skewed. I've got a long, right tail here, and that's gonna pull the mean over like that. So we'll be ready to peak, because these values are gonna pull that number out. But all we're doing here, is I'm literally saying, what's my expected dollars that I get? I've got a 50% chance of earning one set. I've got a 50% chance of earning a million dollars. And that gives me $500,000. And that's the expected value, really by the probabilities. No, exactly. And that's it. That's it. Okay, so, now we're gonna talk about diversification in just a second here. But before we get there, you just wanna introduce you to a couple of other ideas really quick. So hold on to that thought, because I'm sure some of you are on your cloud about diversification. But I just wanna talk a little bit more about risk and return before we get there. So one thing, this is like not something we're gonna use at time in my class, but I feel like if you're never gonna take another finance class, you should know about this thing. I didn't fall. So, if I just tell you, you're expected earnings from this dealer, no deal is $500,000. That's not enough information to actually know if it's a good bet or a bad bet. Right? What am I missing? What other information do you need to know? The very risk, right? You need to know something about the risk. So all the time, I can't tell you how it's gonna happen in national media, talking to my buddy, whoever, people are like, oh, this is a great deal. You're gonna earn $100,000 or whatever. And they don't ever mention the risk. And I can't evaluate an investment opportunity without also knowing the risk. It's impossible to know that. So, the sharp ratio is one tool that financial economists use to measure this. A sharp wasn't the person by the name of the team up with this. It's just this. It's my expected return for investment I, so that's just any investment. If I ever do an I as a subscript, it's being any generic investment at all. Minus the risk-free rate divided by the sigma I, where sigma I is the standard deviation of those returns. Now just take a quick second, stare at that, think about it for a minute, and then tell me, what is that thing measuring? I know you're still writing it down. Okay. You guys have a second to look at it. See, let's hear from John down in Porter's John. There we go. JD, that's right, JD, okay. JD, can you just kind of stare at the same, put it in the words for me, what is this thing trying to measure? Just do your best. Let's see, we have a expected return minus your, minus the risk-free rate. Minus the risk-free rate. So just focus on that numerator. What is that numerator? So just, is that just risk? Is it just, tell me why you just said that? What do you mean is that just risk? It's like return, I'm just like the, maybe what you actually, the expected outcome maybe. Okay, good, yeah. So here I've got an expected outcome, right? And why would I subtract off the risk-free rate? Because you don't know that's for sure, right? Because I don't know if this is for sure, and I do know I can get this one for sure, right? So we would, we would call this numerator your excess return, the extra that you're earning above the risk-free rate. That's your excess return. It's like, I'm expecting to earn something more than the risk-free rate. Would I ever invest in something that earns lower than the risk-free rate if it is risky? No, because you can always get the risk-free rate for sure. So why would I take my measure risk? If it's earning less than the risk-free rate, that wouldn't be a sense, right? Except for everyone who plays the lottery, because this is all the time. The risk-flowers out there. So up here we've got this excess return. This is, I want this numerator to be bigger small. Big, big. Big, I love it, right? I want this to be big, okay? What's my denominator? It's for anybody. Standard deviation. Standard deviation, what is standard deviation? Variance. Swerved variance, and variance is... Risk. Right? So it's just a measure of risk. It's just a measure of risk, hence all it is. So I want the numerator to be large. I want my denominator to be small. I would love it if I can get huge, excess returns and very little risk. That would be fantastic. But typically they go hand in hand, and this way I'm scaling them by each other so that I can put everything on an equal playing field, and I can measure two different investments and say, oh, that was going to show up pretty soon. 1.5, and that was only 1.3. I like the 1.5 better. That's bang for my buck, basically. Okay, down. So is this basically two different forms of measuring risk compared to each other's better idea of risk? Because, I understand right, the return on investment is equal to risk plus risk free, but it means that this is... The numerator is just another way of measuring the risk and that equation. And so it feels like a second measure. I see exactly what you're saying. And that's really close to the right idea, but here's like one key difference. Remember when I'm talking about this equation here for a discount rate, a discount rate is my opportunity cost. So this is measuring the rate return on my next best investment. And I know this is super confusing. This is the expected return on my investment. So it could be that this investment is actually better than my next best thing, and therefore this is going to be higher. So that can be clarified. Yes. If you're going to follow that, it really doesn't matter too much. Yes. So if someone is the only way to work properly to spread for a short time, something best, then where do they get the data for this standard equation? Is it like someone bought all that a bunch of assumptions? Like where does that data come from? It's yes, but typically they use a lot of historical data. And you hope that the future looks like that one's because no one knows the future. So what we want is my standard deviation of future returns. That would be the right thing to do here. No one knows that number. So you're going to use other similar investments to see how they perform in the past, or just keep the investment in the house. What it's an deviation for in the past. And hope is that is similar to what I'm talking about. That's pretty much it. Out this is essentially the question signal with the Ferrari in the state of his camera. This is the difference that that exists return and then finding the, there's kind of a breaking of point at some point and then you're directly beyond that. Yeah, true or the same? Yeah. OK? Yeah, so just so I'm like, kind of figure out what this would look like a post run. I think you're going to do it. But like for a speed rate, it's going to be enough percentage. Yes. The expected return is also going to be enough. Also in percent. But we almost always manage to those in percent, guys. Yeah, cool. Yep. Exactly. Yep. And we'll actually do the standard deviation in percentage terms as well. So it's all the same units. Cool. So let's just draw a little graph here. We're on the x axis. I'm going to have this standard deviation. And on the y axis, I've got the numerator. OK. Where would the risk-free rate go on this graph? If I have a risk-free investment, where would I draw that? Jake, if it's risk-free, where should I put it? No, where I'm supposed to be in the y axis. Yeah, it's going to be over here because there's no standard deviation. It's risk-free. There's no risk. There's no variance. There's no standard deviation. Standard deviation is zero. It's risk-free. That's the definition of risk-free. So it's going to be over here. Now, it's going to be right here. In this case, it would be, yeah. Right there. Because it'd be risk-free minus risk-free. So I'm right here at the origin. OK. Now, pick any other investment. We do know a deal or something else. Typically, I'm going to have another investment that would be like out here. Where I've got some expected returns, so I move up here. But I also have some risk that goes along with that. And if I draw, I'm going to draw a perfectly straight line. Get ready. Here you go. If I draw a line through that, this is called, what do they call this? I know it's called the cow line. I just can't remember what's the answer for capital allocation. Capital allocation line. Yeah. Thank you. It's in my notes from plus years. This is what I'm hired to use. This is called a cow line. Capital allocation line. And the reason why we call it that is, suppose we're in a world where all I have are two possible investments. I've got the risk-free investments. And I've got some investment I. I can put all my money in the risk-free investment and earn the risk-free rate. I can put all my money in investment I. And on this, I have this much risk. Can I ever get here? Sure. Yeah. But some of my money in the risk-free, some of my money in investment I, and I'm going to end up with some average of that across my portfolio. Can I get down here? Yeah. Can I get here? Yeah. And in this fake little world we've made up, if I can borrow money, I can actually get out here too. Because I borrow money from people, and that increases my leverage. A borrow money I invest in the risk-free thing, and that increases the leverage, which increases the risk, and also increases the return. It's kind of like how right now on my house, I'm earning a lot more than house price appreciation. Because I have a mortgage on my house. So the value of my house goes up. I earn a lot more than just the increases that I have. OK? So I can go anywhere along that line, even with just two investments. What's the slope of this line? It's the sharp ratio. Exactly. Is my rise overrun? It's the sharp ratio. And what I want is a steep of a line as I can possibly find. That's what I want. That's you fast. Questions? Who's feeling entirely lost? Right? A little bit. OK, you could feel lost. This is a good place to feel lost relative to the other one. OK. Jet? Are we mapping the investment, like the return, or are we mapping the interest on the other rates? You're expected return. Which is, if it's alone, that is basically the same thing as the interest. But if it's a stock, it wouldn't necessarily. The stocks don't have interest rates. Thank you. Do you have any particular question, David, or are you just feeling Mike, I'm not really sure about that? What's the risk of the sand? Do you have any signs that are important? Besides, do you have no guilt? Yeah. Sure. But we'll examine that. So imagine, tomorrow, for whatever reason, all of the companies in the world cease to exist, except for Tesla. Oh. Oh. This is a great world or a terrible world, depending on who you are. OK. But we still have Treasury bonds as well. We only have those two investments. Those are the only things that I can possibly invest in. You've got $100,000. You take $100,000. If you put it all into Treasury's, you're going to earn like 4% and you're going to earn that for sure. That would put you here. Isn't that the zero? So what could be higher? This is an x and a y, right? Yeah, yeah. So this is zero. But you're going to earn zero excess returns. So you're going to earn 4%, but nothing more than the risk rate. So that y-axis is the excess return, not the cloud return. OK. There we go. I knew there was such a thing that I just made clear. Zero. Yep. Yep. So you're still going to earn 4%, but nothing more no excess return at all. No. If you take $100,000, you invest it all in Tesla. You went about here, you're going to earn on average more than 4%. But you're going to have some years that are terrible and some years that are good, and you have to like go along with that roller coaster rate. You've got variance in those returns. And I don't like that variance, but I've got a higher return. I get compensated for it. And that would put me up here. And in that world, every investor can choose where they want to be on that line by allocating their funds across his investments. That's basically what we're seeing. OK. But what I would like to do, what I would really like to do, is I would love to find a dot where. But anywhere above this line, if that dot's here, or here, or here, or here, or here, or here, or here, anywhere above that line, I would love it because that increases the slope of my line. And I could move on down that line to get to the level of risk and return that I want. So even if it's out here, and I don't like that much risk, if I can draw this line, good luck. If I can draw that line, I don't want to be up there. But I can find a dot that's down here. And I'm really happy about that relative to this dot right here, because I get a little risk for the same return. Let me set up. So what every investor out there in the world is looking for is higher sharp ratios, steeper lines. That's what everyone's looking for. And we're trying to find those magical things. And I'm here to tell you, there's mostly don't exist. But there is one free lunch. As economists, we don't believe in free lunch. There is one free lunch. And that's called the classification. And that's what we're going to talk about right now. And that's going to be that of the business that's the other example. That's the other example. Yeah, of course. So here is the power of the investment. Yes. So suppose we're in this world where it's just risk to create a Tesla. And then another investment pops up. And if I'm here, I don't want to invest in that thing. We're ignoring diversification. With diversification, you might want to invest in that. But if there's no diversification, I would never choose to put any money in that thing. Because it's a lower sharp ratio. And I can get either higher returns for the same risk or the same returns for lower risk by moving to the other investments. So this one's like dominant. Yeah. OK. Great. Other questions? OK. Now, I want to go back to dealing with a deal for a second. You're playing dealing with a deal. You've got one briefcase. You're holding on to your briefcase. But you've got how we deal with this class? 47? 46, but you're really close friends. Or also, all playing dealing with deal, all at the same time. And for whatever reason, what's the intro hosting? How we deal? That didn't have a lot of time. I was right. How we deal? How we deal? How we mendel? How we mendel leads the room for a second. And he leads you guys alone for a second. What are you going to propose? Oh, we don't think it's good. Everybody take it. Yes. Let's all write a contract that we all put whatever money we win, we put it into a pot, and we split it even made across the 47. And we're going to enter into that contract. Would you take that? Would you take that contract? Yes. OK, come out. Three market tax. It's actually free markets. What are you paying? Well, OK, that's the time we're going to get to. So maybe John sits out of this contract. John, I'm not in. But the rest of you all think how we walked back in, the bigger calls you up and says, hey, I'll give you $300,000. You take that? Now what do you do? No, why not? I'm expecting somebody to improve it. I'm expecting value. They expect value is $5,500,000 before. You expect value of your bet changed? No. What changed? The risk, right? Before, you are either going to get one cent or $1 million. What is the probability you get one cent if you all enter into this contract that you share your bet? Oh, I'm going to get one cent. Almost. Two hundred and forty-seven. It's one half raised to the 47th half. It's zero, basically, right? Because you would all, all 47 if you would have to grab that one cent. And the probability of that is incredibly low. You all grabbed that one cent. Now, of course, what's the probability you get a million dollars? Also, basically, zero, because you would all have to grab the one million dollar of your bet. And the probability of that is actually really low as well. So what have we done? We've kept the same expected value, but we shrunk the variance. Because across the 47th of you, it's like a cling flip, 47 times. You're going to end up with roughly 23 heads and 24 tails. My brain stopped working for three seconds. It's going to be roughly half and half. And so you're all going to get almost exactly five hundred thousand dollars with a little bit of variance around that five hundred thousand dollars. So the banker calls up and says three hundred thousand dollars. You say no way. Because of four hundred thousand dollars, you say no way. You're going to get a like four hundred ninety thousand dollars and then you're finally taking it with the banker with all the time. Because you're almost for sure going to get five hundred thousand dollars. That makes sense? So what have you done? You've diversified your risk. What you did is you took a distribution, a distribution, well actually, look, you took this distribution. That's not what we get on here. You took this distribution, which was either one cent or a million dollars. And you converted it to a distribution that looks like this, centered on five hundred thousand dollars. That makes sense? Through the power of diversification. Basically what you all did is you all took a one-fourty-seventh bet in every single briefcase. By contracting together and saying we're going to pool our money because I'm just splitting it up. Separate Johnson's out. So it's one-fourty-sixth. Three hundred thousand dollars. Okay? Now, I said a second ago, this is like free lunch. Why am I so chastised about this? Why is this great? I didn't change your respective value. Why would I say this is like a free lunch? A reduced risk without doing one. Without harming my respective return. That's the free lunch. The cool thing about diversification is not that you didn't get a reduced risk. It's not just that. So often I think people are like, oh, diversification is good, you get rid of risk. I can get rid of risk. I just invest in the risk for your rate. That's easy. The power of diversification is you reduce risk while keeping the same expected value. I crank up the sharp ratio. That's what's cool about diversification. Is I get an increase in that sharp ratio? Well, this is the point of mutual funds. This is the whole point. If we want to make diversification as easy as possible for people. I go and I buy a mutual fund or buy an ETF or whatever. An index fund. I get a little tiny bit of every stock in the S&B 500. That is great for me because I don't actually want to place bets on individual stocks. I don't like that risk. I'd rather take the aggregate risk and diversify the way all the tedious and credit risks. I'm certainly not thinking about this. I've got to correct this. Why wouldn't it be a million dollars divided by 47? How are you all splitting it? Because half of you are only getting to get one cent. But the odds are still that 50, 50, like half of you have one cent and half. How is that less? You have a briefcase. Yes. That briefcase is 50, 51, where are the other? Anna also has a briefcase. And hers is 50, 50. And it's independent from yours. You might have a million and she has one cent. You might have one cent, she has a million. You might both have a million and you might both have one cent. They're unrelated to each other. But Corbin also has one and Nephi has one and Caroline has one and Haydall and on average, you're going to come out with $500,000. Is that enough? Yeah. Yeah. Basically, you're going to come out with $23 or $24 million if you can't buy that by 47. Exactly. I end up with $20,000. Roughly half of you getting $1 million. We'll do that by 47. Okay. So for John, if John works with one cent, he's really sad. Or works with $1 million, he says you're all suckers. You were way too pure luck, it was not skill on him. Typical. Okay. So then, yeah, go ahead, it's good. So that point, by him, I'm going into it. He lowers our overall diversification. Yeah, he harms all the rest of you. Just try to get him to the job. The market paid. Okay. So the magic here is what I get with diversification is if we're in, I mean, he's just going to let us three million. We're not actually in a world just one stock and the risk for your test land risk for your rate. We're actually in a world with a whole bunch of these things. There's all these stocks all over the place. And the magic of diversification is by investing in all of these, I end up with a sharp ratio that's something I pull over here above everything. And there's not everything, but almost everything in the future. And I can invest, this is what we call the market portfolio. Which is just, I'm taking all of these different stocks and bonds that every possible investment that's out there and by diversifying, by investing in all of them, I get rid of a lot of their individual risk because when one thing pays off, when Christie's briefcase is one cent, maybe Anna's is a million dollars and those counterbalance each other. And so I reduce a lot of that risk and I end up with the same expected return as all of these, but with lower risk because I've diversified across many, many options. And all of the little bets wash each other, wash each other out. Any other question, Anna? No. Oh, okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. What you're describing is that all of these invest adoptions below the cow line, that's what you're aggregating right, it's all below the cow line. So they're not all below this black cow line? Some of them are above, some of them are below. And if I can only invest in one, I want to invest in the one that's the steepest here. But diversification says, actually, magically, you're better off investing a little bit in all of them. And that pushes your risk way over here and steepens your overall cow line. Is that makes sense? That's kind of the most. Okay. Yeah, last question then we got to end. Go ahead. And then, what's your share of ones in the market for a little bit? Is it like a state? No, so the market for a little bit still isn't safe. So this is where we're going to pick up a nice hand actually. There's still risk here. I can't diversify away all risks. But if the market for a little bit is basically the lowest risk we can have and still get the average return of the market. That's basically what that was. Okay. All right. Good work, everyone. I will see you in 30 days."
