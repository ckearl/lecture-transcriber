  "text": "Okay, so a couple of hours to be getting started today, I think it's your day. I'm a last Thursday because you guys are all going to be going. I don't stand for black, are you? You stand. I don't. You stand for black. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. You're breaking. Do something. In my company. I mention a few times when I start to tell that you've been attracted to the most, that That's when I got to work. Don't ask, but. It's a very competitive play, the platform of the party. We come today, we're going to be doing the World Cup case. So good time to be thinking about that, starting to work on that. Remember to put that in, you send that on your hand going to send it up to bring it here in person. One person for groups, and then so that's going to be from today's. But if you're really looking ahead, the next class after that comes to that number two, we can have two. Two guys. Not just third table, but the next third table. OK. Question, do you have a read about it? You have that? I'll see what's clear. Yeah. The whole concept is, we're going to accomplish this. Yes. World.com. Yeah. It helps if you complete it. No, the case is, I would highly recommend that you take a look at the document on Canvas called case grading guidelines. I can only have exactly how I check it. Case is six. They are out of 35 points. They're running through the case of the same grade. Really, I'm looking for three things. Well, three things for one issue, because it's different. Three things that I can run the cases. The first is, you're almost always having to make some sort of assumptions in case. In case with you, lots of information, but at some point, you can have some kind of assumption. Tell me what assumptions you're making and why you're making them. The why you're making them part is what actually matters. So that's the first thing I'm looking for. What assumptions did you make? Why did you make them? The second thing I'm looking for is, do you do the analysis correctly? So that's more mechanical. That's more kind of black or white right or wrong. These assumptions are less black or white, right? One group might make it a red assumption or another group in a much less associated way around. Doing the analysis correctly, more kind of black or white, that's what we're looking for. And then thirdly, do you draw reasonable conclusions based on your analysis? And are those conclusions clear? Again, that's more subjective. And then the fourth thing that's kind of different from those three is I do tell the TAs to create based on how good your writing is. So it used to be concise. It used to be clear. If you go on and on about details that don't matter, it will lose points. You have incomplete sentences, you'll lose points. If you don't tell me something, I do need to know you will also lose points. So it's like writing that, writing down. That's how we created it. J. What is the fourth thing? You're writing it. Oh, right. That doesn't mean I don't need to be fancy. Don't put it in the crazy fonts. I don't care about thinking of that at all. But I do care that the writing itself is good. Yeah, for you, it's bullet points. I'm OK with bullet points. Yeah, absolutely. Yep. Just anything that you might put in like your professional document, like suppose you're a pencil for World Count. And you're submitting this to them. That's the question. You want to like a mental audience? Yes, something to get. So you know what I mean? You have to be that hard. That first group wrote it down by question. So you don't get to have questions on there. And you're like, answer it in two or three. Or you want it to be like an asset. It's fine if you break it down by question. But I do want it to read as if you're writing this to be exactly World Count. So I put the, I don't know. So you find the balance between those. Again, I'm not crazy, crazy picky about this. But I do care a lot about doing that. That's what I do. Awesome. Other questions? OK. Cool. Let's get started for today. Where do we leave our last time? Beta, baby. Yes. Beta. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. You know. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I just want to know. I can't. OK. Tell me this. Let's start here. Do you see a photo here in the middle of the diagram? Why on earth would you ever care about estimating beta? Do you see a post-itting? You can be a little like that. I can't. I can't. I need some of the bigger companies. I'm going to see how we get a computer. More, more, more, more. Use a lot of money. More, more, more, more. I'm going to see more of the company. OK. So, the risk of this company? Yes. Yes. I'm investing in this company. Yeah. That good. So, I'm making some type of investment decision. So, I'm putting some money in. And what do I care about? I care about what comes back out over here. And I don't even, I don't just care about the expected value of what comes out. But there's a risk in it with those cash flows. And so, I'm going to need to know what is the beta of this project that I'm potentially investing in over here. So, I can determine how much do I like these cash flows. OK. Perfect. Why else would I need to like, double beta, come and see a photo here? Yeah. I think that you're helping me figure out your cost of capital, too. So, I think what is... And then using that to prepare that, I said, what you're investing in, what am I doing? What's going to give me a better return than the cost of borrowing or the cost of whatever sort of capital is? Yeah, exactly. So, as CFO, I'm going to go talk to potential investors, and I'm trying to convince them to do what? To give me money, right? Up here. I need capital from them so that I can go invest in things. So, if I'm talking to them, what do they care about? They care about the beta of the cash flows that I'm going to return to them. So, I need to have some sense of what that beta is so that I can make a case for why I'm a better investment than their next best thing, which is exactly what a discount rate is doing. Right? So, I really care a lot about estimating this beta. It might be a beta for set, it might be a beta for equity, or anything else that you could imagine. But, I mean, I care a lot about these betas here, because that's the case I'm making to my investors for why they shouldn't best send me. Is that made a return? High returns relative to the beta that I'm giving them. Okay? That makes sense? I just want to ground that a little bit. Now, when I say beta, what should you be thinking of? Beta is a co-bearance. Awesome. That makes me really happy to hear that. Thank you. And it's measuring co-bearance of what? What? Something of the market. Okay, you said it. The S&P 500? Yeah, the S&P 500, that's on one side, but with a co-bearance, I need two different things. So, S&P 500, I get what? System, or... I get whatever I'm evaluating. Right? So, if I'm evaluating the beta of my equity, this thing, I need to know the co-bearance of my equity with the S&P 500. If I want the beta of my debt, I need the co-bearance of my debt with the S&P 500. If I'm doing it beta over here, I might need the co-bearance of all of the cash was coming from my firm. With the S&P 500. S&P 500. But it's always a co-bearance of something with my S&P 500. It's a well-diversified stockpile of co-bearance. And with that, we end up with this equation that you're all going to want to memorize. If you have a memorize you get this equation is called... Oh, that's really bad, really bad. The capn. Capital. Pass it. Pricing. Modern. So if you ever hear someone mention the capn. We're talking about it. This is exactly what they mean when they say the capn. This is the capn. So what we're going to do today is we're just going to go through several examples of how we use this to bring this down here first. But before we get there, we're going to really like fundamentally around what this thing is doing. Why do I need a model? Why can't I just go look up? I'll just go look up. Go ahead. It's a change. Because they change. That's true, but like the change rate is change and I can go look those up. So it's not just that, Jacob. There's some kind of a getting it underestimated. You're taking your best guess as far as what it's in reach for with. I'm thinking about this. Okay, so Jacob said they don't actually exist. I'm trying to dissent how to process that. Tell me a little bit of what do you mean they don't actually exist. That's not like an exchange rate where it says you can just look at it. It's like a judgement time. and so this is a way of modeling or representing beer's thinking for how you're making that just to call it, how you're creating that list. Okay, tell me what's the judgment call to hang on here? I just the amount of risk that is worth taking on. Okay, about the amount of risk you're comfortable with, yeah, we'll take one of five and predict what that risk is. Good, okay, good. So I totally agree is a judgment call whether I end up investing in something or not, and how much risk I'm willing to take on. I think where I would push back a little is this thing in judgment call. This thing's like there aren't going to be some judgment call things involved in estimating these, but not very much. For most part this is pretty mechanical. And I'm going to use this as a baseline for then deciding on what I invest in. Okay, so I totally get what you're coming from, you're exactly right. It is going to be a judgment call, but that's actually not why I need a model here. I need a model here not because it's a judgment call, but because why? Down. If let's say you're the CFO of the company, you have 10 grains with invested projects, that you have 500 projects with your company, it's not like it's a stock where there's a ton of investment big risks that are doing all the math for you back to look up. You might be the one who has to actually figure out the discount rate or the expected return for each of these things. I figure out what point I'm going to be the best return and the base stock that I've made right this as well. Yeah, yeah. It's basically, remember what it is not really doing? It's adjusting for two things. What are the two things? Time and risk. Okay, time and risk. This is the time part. That's the risk part. There's infinite numbers of different time horizons and risk levels. There's so many of them, and they're also particularly like Down was saying that I can't just go look them up because there's an infinite number. So I have to have a model to actually go out and ask for that. For example, you know, some of you like go out, maybe you're going to start a new company, say you're starting a new company that makes really cool stocks. Well, your stocks might be different from anyone else's stocks that are out there in the world. So you're going to have to do your best, and you're going to have to do your best to figure out what is the systematic risk of stocks out of my stocks in particular, and that's not something you can always just go and look up really easily. And so this is what I can just model to help us think about that more carefully. Does that make sense to everybody? Questions so far? Yeah, so why is this? Because our structure of F is the risk free rate. Yeah. So why is that? In the equation. I don't actually have that name. Okay, good. So this is the risk free rate. And if you remember, when I wrote down to start the whole thing, was this was our model, and all I've got is just translated it from this to letters. Okay. Now why is there a risk free rate adjusting for time? Well, why do I care? Why do I want money today more than I want money in the future? Because I can use it today. Okay. So I'm impatient. What else? You can play through the equation. And because there's inflation. I also might want money today rather than in the future, because there's risky, but I want to separate that out. The risk free rate has no risk in it. But it's still helping, I get returns. If I give someone up my money and they hold it for a while, then you could back. It adjusts for my patience and my money. Does that make sense? Yeah. Thank you. You think so? Yes. But you're only... What percent of it makes sense? 35? Okay. I'll take it. Yeah. Is it far we also using like the US Treasury? I don't know how to say this, but their timelines is that's why it measures time, because we're using the rate of time for the year. So is that right? Like how that's time? Yes. But importantly, we're not using like... It's not whatever the US government wants. It's what the market wants. That's what it's talking about. So if I go out, can I grab a 30-year Treasury rate, which is about 4.75% right now? What is that telling me? That's not what the government wants to be, because what is the government want to be? Zero percent. This is what the market is charging for someone to hold their money for 30 years. So this is telling me, each year you've got to give you 4.75% to compensate me for my expected inflation over that time period, for my impatience, because I would actually rather have that money right now, and you've got to compensate me for that. Does that make sense? So I'm going to use a 30-year Treasury rate if this investment that I'm evaluating is a long-term investment. If it's a two-year investment, I don't want it to be 30-year Treasury. I don't want it to be a two-year Treasury rate. So that's how it's measuring time and space on that. Yes. Awesome. Good. Other questions about this risk recomplening? So that's that part. And then we spent a couple of classes really trying to nail down this part, and I said, the pay-a is something, and the market risk premium is something. What is this? What is that? Sure. Which one's the quantity of risk? It is. It is. It is the quantity of risk. And the market risk premium is the price of risk. So beta is going to tell me how much risk my particular investment has. This thing is set by the market, and this is the price of only one unit of risk. Okay. This is all just review that just showed, like solidified this little bit. That's how I'm going to measure that cost of risk. So we have. One quick note I'm terminating all of you this report before you forget. Sometimes this whole piece is called a spread, especially when you're talking about bonds, and it looks a lot of times or a bond, which we'll call this a spread. And all that means is that extra interest is getting charged above the risk-free rate. The spread above the risk-free rate. That's why they call this thing a spread. Okay. So it's just piece of terminology right here. Okay. So when they say we have a vice, that means a number of popular. Yes. It means it's a risky investment. What about when they say what's the spread in the game tonight? And they're not talking about the capitalists. No relation. No relation. I don't think so. I think you want to fan the number. Generally, generally, the highest risk in the world is in the country. I think negative means like your favorite. So I've been saying that it was a spread. So I've been saying that it was a spread. Oh yeah, I was saying it was a spread. Okay. So let's do a little example. We already did one bond pressing example. So let's do another one just for fun. And also because you're about to do a bond pressing case. You want to issue a three-year bond with a 6% coupon. Okay. You want to issue a three-year bond with a 6% coupon. Now, like how this works in practice is you've got this company, you're the CFO, you want to go to capital markets. So this gives me a little, a little big investment bank here. You can treat you to capital markets. You go and talk to your ex. You guys like that picture of bank whether it's very accurate. That's 10 years of teaching experience. You go to this investment bank and chat with them and say, hey, you know what we like to say? We like to issue a bond. I want to issue a three-year bond. And can you look at our financials and give us an estimate of what coupon we should pay on that bond. That's kind of how this works. Now look at your financials. They'll come talk to potential investors, you get a sense of demand. And they come back and they recommend they say, hey, let's do about a 6% coupon. We think that that's going to be roughly the right rate for you. Okay. That's kind of how this process works. And then we say, okay, great. We print up a bunch of certificates. We go out and we start selling them. And then we find out for sure what the market actually is willing to pay for that bond. And we're not always going to get it exactly right. We're trying to get this exactly right. We're not always going to get it exactly right. So this little example, let's say you go out and sell it. And it sells for, let me get back to the actual number of the cash down here, 9623. Now remember, bond pricing is kind of weird. If I had priced this exactly right, what should this sell for? 100, right? And so I'm selling at a little bit of a discount. And we're going to figure out sort of why that is. But just intuitively, why am I selling at a discount? What did I do down? You're two bond rates, two bond rates a little too high. Or two below. Like you're two bond rates a little too low. Which one is it? A little too low. It's not competitive enough. Exactly. So I go out to sell my bond. And all the investors were like, yeah, I'm not real thrilled about 6%, I wanted a little bit more than 6%. But I'll buy it for Man of the 623. I'm not going to buy it for 100. I'm not going to buy it for part, which is like the face value for one. That's kind of what's going on here. So we misprice it just a little bit. We put that coupon a little bit too low. And investors were a little disciplined in that. Um, darn it, that's my bad. So the question I have for you is, what is my actual cost of debt? If you have that information, what was my actual cost of debt? My coupon rate is 6%. But what's my actual cost of capital? What do I need to know if you did that out? It's like first step here. Exactly. It's a present value. Okay? Good. So, walk me through it. What do I need? So if it's selling for 96.23 or $100, what is the total price of a present value? You'd be like 962 and 30 cents. Uh-huh. Yes. Okay, good. So I've got the present value. Yes. Which is just your selling price. Yep. And then you would just kind of create that present value formula. So you give your coupon rate on the top. Okay. 962.23. Great. So this is from the perspective of an investor, they're going to pay 962.30. They're paying that much. And then what do they get in return in each of these years? 60% of $1,060.60. 60 bucks. And then? 60 bucks. 60 bucks. And then? And then? Uh-huh. 1,060 bucks. 1,060 bucks. Because remember, at the end of this, it's a three-year bond. So at the end of that, I paid them the full face value of the bond. And face value is $1,000. Even though they only paid 962.30, the face value is $1,000. And so they're going to get this cash payment. Okay. That was that survey. So these are my cash flows. And I would like to know what is our D. So what's my last step here? So besides that, I picked on it for one thing. Joseph. Is that like some of your cash flows? It's a present value equation. I'm not going to know. But you said you were going to write that out and install for the rate. Exactly. So I can do it this way. This is my present value. Yeah. And what's my future value? Well, 60 divided by 1 plus RD plus 60 divided by 1 plus RD squared. Plus 1,060 divided by 1 plus RD cubed. And I just need to solve that for RD. What are you going to do? Exactly. This, to be clear, I'm not going to ask you to do something like this on the exam by hand. Because an excelling cubic is like a huge pain. But an excelling is great at it. So I go to Excel. And what function can I use an excelling to solve this? Rate. The rate function. So I go equals rate. And I don't remember the inputs. I have to look at this up every single time. You know? I chance like N per right? Yeah, period. Number of periods, which is 3. And then I don't know the order. I don't know the present value. So the present value is negative 962.3. And then you'll put in the chart. The pain rate is just 60. And then you'll put in the future value, which is the top. I think that's right. So this is number of periods, the present value. The payment. The payment. Yeah, and the future value. Is that right? Yeah. Something like that. Oh, well, then you'll put in column 0 at the end just to tell it that it's like a star 3 period. It's that it's going to be a little bit more difficult. Perfect. Good night. Okay. So this, it would be, so if I was doing this on a homework assignment, I would write out something like this. And then I would just put the answer. And I would go to Excel and I would find that. Engages, I can't do that. Okay. Yeah, Jennifer. For present value, do you always put it at negative? Yeah, that's just like Excel custom. I mean, there is some logic to it. Like the logic is really this. From the investor's perspective, we're losing this much in present value. And then these are positive numbers because that's how I'm gaining the future. That's why they put it in negative here, positive, positive. What are you guys? What is the discount rate on this bond? What's also called the yield to make sure those are going to be the same thing. Okay. Now, turns out, if I type this in, I'm going to get a discount rate. Now, what do you guys just pay to just get higher or lower than 6%. Higher. See, we higher, right? Because we just said, we missed price this bond by putting this coupon too low. So I got that wrong and I'm going to get a discount rate. If you put it in, I think it's 7.45%. You can know what's that mean to see if I got that right. Yeah. It's happy with that. Okay. If you see something I would highly recommend is you're working on 12 sets of cases or whatever. Did you cast that question after this second you go before the answer for the word? Do you expect this number to be higher or lower than you can monitor it? That type of question is the type of thing that's going to tell you to do abs and thinning it in your mind. Is anyone can type this in? But not everyone is going to have that intuition that this should be higher and that sort of gut check. Okay, yeah, this is exactly what I expected. Okay. So that's, I don't know how to teach people to ask those questions but try to ask yourself those questions. Yeah, I mean, you guys need to solve it for whatever number the coupon of the person should have been or a result for the first time. Exactly. Exactly. So if we had gone to our investment maker and the investment maker did it right, they would say, you know what you should say? You could buy a 7.4% and if we had done that it would have sold for a thousand instead of nine sixty two thirty. Right? And because we got this wrong it sells for less. Okay, why can't we go ahead? I'm just wondering like we've mispriced it but because we've put a lot of money over the less for that like it's all the same price. Like we're making a little bit less for getting a little bit of a really good question, really good question. Okay, so from our, like, let's think about two. From our perspective, what is happening here? Suppose I just sell one bond just to keep it simple. What, what cash flow do I get up here? Oh, I get that nice thing. I get nine sixty two thirty here. Is that being being happier, sad? Because I wanted a thousand bucks. I had an investment for a thousand dollars over here and I came up short. Okay? So I'm not real thrilled with that. The other thing to think about is what is the return that I'm giving back to my investors? I'm giving them a 7.45% return. I am paying back cost. I'm not paying six percent. I'm paying seven point four five percent. This, you can't escape. The market tells you what this is. I don't get a set this number. And so, like, when I have your sad about that, well, I would love to pay zero, right? Just like the federal government. But this is what I have to pay. So I wouldn't say this makes me have your sad. But the fact that I didn't get as much money as I wanted probably makes me sad. And that's when I fired my investment bank. Do you have your sense? Because he won't pay that. Yes, he doesn't. But that's what it was. Because they bought the ball on the 9602. The coupon was 6%. Yeah. You can't escape the 7.45% because you're now paying higher interest because we are reasonable to the 6% on top of the 9602. That becomes a higher percentage and that's the 7.45% that you actually think. Yes, exactly the 6%. They gave me $9.62 in 3 cents. I'm paying them interest as if they gave me $10. So I'm not paying 6%. I'm paying 7.45%. Jason. So even if we went wrong the other way so we gave it 8% when it should have been 7.45, it still ends up ending up where the market sets it at 7.45%. Yes. We just got to probably get a little bit more than a thousand of them per year but then you'll pay. Exactly. So if it was the other way and would say the 8% coupon instead of 7.45, then I mean you can get something more than a thousand a year. That still doesn't necessarily make me happy. Because then I've got to figure out what to do with that. Do I not sell any bonds? Do I stick to that savings account which is probably less than 8% is really not great. You want to get it right. But you're exactly right. You're always going to say that this is a system. You're always going to get it right. Perfect. So you say the market is worth 9.62. 30 minutes. 30 minutes. Yeah. So the investor bank, they're not the ones buying these bonds. Sometimes they'll backstop the end of that. Don't worry about that. They're the ones selling these bonds. They go out to the market. They're going to have a bunch of investors that they often build it. So they call up whoever. Hedge funds, pension funds, down the funds, insurance companies. They'll start calling, they call it building the book. They start building up demand for the same. I've got like, you know, 10,000 of these bonds that sell which you lack in the air. And then person on the other end says, yeah, I'm interested but I'm not going to pay the party. I'm not going to pay the party. And that's the best thing. So the best thing is connecting to those types of things. You know, they were going to sell it through a price. You know, they're going to have to pay the same thing. They build people out of an auction of things. But like lots of times they don't put anything into the price of it. There's not as much to start building this because you might be making it a tree. Yeah. So if you go back to the KMM's, essentially, based on this, that would be a KMM incentive spray. We just now see that the RI is something that would provide, if you have a specific, you know, sort of risk for how it's worth, or a temporary bond for a person worth a nice thing. But the market is burned, with that time, then you could figure out what data is, and that's essentially what the investment is. Probably that's just the riskiness of this. Yes. Exactly. And we're going to do exactly that. I'm just saying two minutes. I mean, I started with that question. But yeah, exactly. Yep. Yeah. So I just understand that coupon rate is essentially what the investment bankers decide. This is what is worth based on my financials. And the yield to maturities with the market is actually what it's actually worth. And I'm kind of comparing those to see whether it will be valid in a valid kind of situation. Yeah. Exactly. So this is called the yield to maturity. That's the actual market rate. The coupon rate really is a thing that we just kind of make up when we print on this certificate. And we're trying to predict what the yield to maturity is going to be. In this case, we got it wrong. But typically, when they invest and make issues to bond, they try to have the coupon rate match that yield to maturity. In this case, we got it wrong. How do we know that? We know it right off the bat because it's sold for about 700. Oh, it's 1000. It's sold for under part. How? We have a lot of strings in it. And why would anyone? Why would it ever transact for not a thousand years? It feels like all these institutions are smart enough that everyone knows. You know what I mean? Like, they're, you know, they can do the same math that we're doing. So I guess, but then that would mean that the market is, right? Because we need some, there needs to be a disparity. But like, what scenario would someone be okay because they're going to know they're buying it? Maybe they're wrong. It's one rate or so. I don't understand that part. Okay, so, what do we, your question is, why did this transaction happen? Right, you know, why we're at the same part? Anyone who's buying these on mass scales, is smart enough to know that that's probably not big. We could quickly do this and figure out what's not very impressed, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so first of all, I can cut through this example so that the numbers are more extreme than the numbers here. However, new bond issues are almost never traded exactly at all. And that's because predicting what the market demand is going to be is not perfect. So you know what's the best way to do that? They're going to make some calls before they actually go out and build the book and stuff. So they're going to make some calls for the Fed to ask, right? But they're never going to be exactly right. And so a lot of them just see these things, you know, one with price at like a thousand, or sorry, one hundred point one three. And sometimes they'll be like 99.7 and four. And that just means we're off by a little bit because there's a few basis points. So they think someone who thinks they're smarter than the market, or predicting the market. No, it's not that they think they're smarter than the market. It just means you can do that at this rate. Have you ever sold anything on eBay? Yeah, I've never been surprised at the price at a sold for it. Why didn't you just set the price for the price at a sold for it? In the first place. Why were you surprised? Exactly. That's exactly the same situation here. It doesn't really know exactly what the market's going to be. If you come to them, I work for AT&T and AT&T is if we want to issue bonds, that was going to be pretty easy. Because AT&T is issue bonds for a long time. So you can get that one really close. But if I'm, you know, some new company that's come along and they're making this kind of weird thing. They're just trying to predict roughly what the market's going to be. Just like when you set your initial bid or something, you're trying to predict roughly what the market's going to be. And then you find out when you actually run the auction. That was it? It hurt. And things that would affect like market things that would affect if they like trust in the company. Like what are these things they're saying they could affect? Yeah, very good question. Luckily, we have a model for that. What's going to affect it? People's installation expectations? They're time horizon. That we know pretty well though. Like company acquisitions, like that you think you're going to bring more money? Yeah. So that's going to affect it. And that's almost only going to affect it in terms of its bail. The riskiness of what how risk is this investment? And this is why I like spread this so important. And I think that's why people are really looking at how much extra money earning above the risk of your rate that makes you want to invest in this. And now you're looking at is this coming to get into acquisitions? When are they going to do those? What's the likelihood that they repay, etc. Those are all the things that they're looking at. Okay. Awesome. Good. Other questions? Something knows exactly how much money is getting though if they buy that long. So what's the risk? Yeah, what's the risk? Okay, perfect. That's exactly where I want to go. So let's go there. We've got a lot of other good questions right here. Are you ready to move to the next part of this? Okay. So I'm going to give you a tiny bit more information. What if... Oh, I've been walking from there to here. I forgot the number. What is the risk? What is the risk? We made this 4.8%. And the market risk premium. Let's go with the low number today. I'm going to give you a 5%. Okay. Remember market risk premium is this thing. Okay. If both things are true, what is your debt pay? Take a minute and take a minute. If you're totally lost out of your debt, ask your neighbor. But I think you can keep your debt. I'll give you a line of two minutes. Okay. Okay. Oops. Yeah. Oh my God. I'm going to give you a second. Yeah. What are I? Are I? This is my generic. Oh, where are you doing the same? I'm going to give you a second. I'm going to give you a second. I'm going to give you a second. I'm going to give you a second. Why am I not saying that? Because we are. Okay. So that is because R I is also called the discus. I don't know. So then that's a low variant. Oh, there you go. Here you guys got it. You said you were a temporary grant. I'll give you a few more seconds. We're going to try to start it. What are we going to do that often? I have something right in the 11. I have something right in the 12. We're definitely going to have to be pp. That's an obvious case. It's a person. J. Don. That's friends. I'm going to find the def data. You guys have got my popsicles. What's my first step here? I'm going to put a D now. I'm going to put a D. Did you see that? That's a doubt. I'm going to have to take it. It just depends on one side. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. I'm going to put it in the bottom. Okay. I've got a def data. What does that mean? What does the market want to say? Should I expect most debt to have a beta less than one? No. That is less risky than equity. It still has some systematic risk. We can see that because this beta is not zero. It doesn't have quantity zero. It's got less than the market. A lot of debt has been more than the point two range. This is actually relative to the risky debt. Now, we need risky. Is that risky that the company will pay it? Or is it just the risk of what will actually be the actual risk? When I say risk, you guys have been very, and when I say systematic risk, which is what made this measuring, but wait, Chris Johnson is really a question. Where is the co-operance here? Are I paying $60 or $1,060 a month or what? If the market does really well, am I going to be like, oh, you know what? We did great this year. We're going to pay a little more than 60. No, we never do that. Because we're greedy capitalists. That's why we never do that. If the market does really poorly, am I going to pay over back? Yes, because I hate bankruptcy. Banker is not fun for anybody. I try all through me looking at the cans to avoid that. Even if the market does poorly, I'm probably going to pay $60, $60, $60, $60, $60. Where is the systematic risk? So, the Deand like rates changing. So, it's like the risk for rate suddenly increases. Because of inflation, then it's something like, oh, like, that's 6% coupon that I'm getting. Actually, it would really rather have something like 99% coupon. So, it's like a, especially depending on how long that one is going. Yeah, perfect. So, that's exactly one type of risk. So, that's called interest rate risk. There's a risk that interest rates change. And I got left into this coupon that doesn't change at all. And that risk has some co-curates with the rest of the market. And that generates some systematic risk in the debt. So, that's one type. What else, if you're a bond investor, what do you really worry about? Like, is there a risk for the company failing? Am I going bankrupt? Yeah. Disvolved risk. So, it's called defaulting on your bond when you don't pay the interpayment. As much as from what to bet over backwards and make that happen, sometimes they can. Now, when is it firm most likely not able to repay its debt? When they really needed that money, and it did not kind of have its effect, because they needed the money in the first place, because they didn't have the liquid capital for their own investment. So, then if they're back when other investments are really good, then if they're with capital needed, then they don't have that liquid capital. Yeah, okay. And if I boil that down a little bit, they're most likely not paid. What are all their other investments aren't doing well? Well, there's a recession, for example. Guess when there's most defaults during recessions. Does that generate a systematic risk? Yeah, that's cool for us, right? So, last time in class, I drew this graph that kind of looked like this, where I had the market, and then I had a high-vated stock for this. If I was to map out, I don't know if this would be my artworks going to find out. If I was to map out my payments from a bond, most likely they look like this. They're just flat. I pay 60, 60, 60, about 60, they're certain they don't cool very good markets. But there's some probability that the firm defaults every single period in here. And that probably is highest in recessions. And so, this is like the most likely thing, but actually what I want is not the most likely, but I actually want my expected value, which is going to be something like this, which creates a little bit of beta, right? Because there's some probability that I default here, and that probability pulls down those expected payments a little bit. Most likely they're not going to deploy, but they might. And if they do, I lose everything, and it sucks. And so, I'm worried about that, and that creates a little bit of beta. Does that mean sense? So, that's on top of the integer at risk, and it's still going to point out, which is also there. If we're not going to worry a ton of that in my class, but it's also there. That makes sense, everybody. Questions? Yeah, that. You mentioned the 0.53 is a relatively risky death. So, on that, like, probably, it looks like this is a high-level integer. Yeah, I do this really needed. For this particular one, 0.53, it's actually probably more kind of like this. Because this is relative. Most deaths, most deaths safer than this, and it's going to have just very, kind of slight variation here. This one's a riskier one, which means probably this is a high-level integer already. They don't need much to tip them to the point where that's probably the only thing that's really hot. We worry about that a lot. Yeah. That's why it sells for less. That's it. Yeah. Like, oh, it's an L over here, so I'm not looking at it. Yeah. Or, differently, I'd say the same thing. That's why investors are charging a really high yield to maturity. Yeah, well, perfect. Yeah, people so much so, because now about why it's going up. Like, I understand what we're going to talk about with its default risk, and when there's a recession, but we just said that if the economy's doing really well, it's not going to change. Yeah. So, right, I don't understand why. Yeah, good question. You've got to ask my question. Think of, like, this line here, I don't know if you can see this. That's 60. That's like, that's meaning we're paying our interest for short. We're never actually paying our interest for short. But the probability we definitely, we pay our interest, is really high during mid-times, and then it's lower during bad times. So, I'm never going to go above this, and what's the most likely thing that's going to happen? The most likely thing is we actually still end up here. But we're never going to pay above that, and there's some probability we pay below that, and that pulls the whole thing lower. I got my sense of difference. Okay. Awesome. Yep. Sorry, I thought the lower the more it lowers the more it is, the less risk you pay, the more it is. Yeah. The more it might not be, the less risk you pay. Yeah, sorry, but that's me being unclear. That is low risk compared to the market, which is, the market is a well-reversed, it's stock market, but this is still low risk. But it's high compared to most other bonds. Most bonds have a beta of light, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, that type of range. And this happens to be, the way you priced it, the way I made up my example, happens to be a risky bond. So, it's risky relative to the bonds. Yeah. Now. So, if a bond has a high risk, that essentially means that it has a low probability? Probably. Yeah. You have no credit rate? Sorry. Kind of let a chubbable denote this case as well. Credit rating sets this company is called the S&P, the newies of Fitch, the rate bonds. And they just give them a letter, just like I just mentioned, a rate. Where the least risky is a triple A bond, and the most risky is like a C or a D bond, and they just rate them a nice according to these categories. So, you got triple A, triple A, triple A, double A minus one down, all the notches. Okay. Yeah. So, there's a quick comment that some of my, those read last night that helped out to understand like, where bonds fit in. It's kind of like the, the, the company that has asset equals Y, billies, and all the equity, uh-huh. The like, phone, buy into it, I could buy stock, and then I've got the equity side. Yeah. Where, if the company does well, a part owner, so I can engage as much as the company does. But if I do bonds, I'm on the liability side, where now I'm loaning money to the company, and I'm capped at how much I can gain, give them energy to the super well, I can only earn a certain amount from the bonds, else if the company goes down, I'm on the liability side of that equation, so I'm personally getting paid, not equity people, they're whatever it's like. Yeah. Exactly. So, the reason why debt is less risky than equity, is there is a force to get paid if we hit financial trouble. An equity who is what we call the residual claimant, which just means whatever is left over, they can. So, we do really well, equity gets it, that's great. We do really poorly, equity loses everything. First, before we get, before we get, we do the same thing. Yeah. That was all the same. So, of course, with this, like, where you have the 60, it doesn't quite reach it, right? If we're talking, it's not a fly, it's not a dash, but where it was like, let's start a ball at that, dotted line, but the higher pay, that's it. Mm-hmm. Right? Yeah. Is there still kind of a naive line where it's like, we don't white get that, or is that not with Emily? Because with equity, there's no promise to pay that. Oh, okay. So, that's why with equity, and this is like, just going back to a chick, we're saying, that if you guys are unlimited upside, as well, so we could get lots and lots and lots of money, or could lose everything. Yeah. So, there's no real line here. But with debt, we have a contract that says, I'm going to pay you 6%. But if not, you're going to lose that word. Yes. Exactly. Okay. Good? Chris. One more thing, a bond, it's like kind of like worth, what the bank, it's like we're giving you an interest rate, based on how much we think. Oh? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Exactly. So, bond, prices go, or like coupon prices go across the board, is that something almost like a sign of a anticipated recession, because you're going to be charging more, because they see it at all of this. Okay. Can we, can we either bet, or, so you're pointing to this, it could be that the risk of your rate went up. And all yields, I'm sure you still have a risk of your rate went up. That's not necessarily a sign of recession. That probably means people's expected inflation time. So you have to like parse those things apart. You can do that pretty easily if you have a Treasury rate. If Treasury's go down, and bond yields all go up, what should you do? Run for the hills. Because what that means is, it means everyone's trying to buy Treasury's right now and no one wants to buy bonds, because everyone's worried all the bonds are going to default. The risk spread, this risk premium is going to up a lot, because everyone's worried about that, and this is an added risk. It didn't happen in the market. So if you see Treasury's fall, and bond yields go up, that's the sign of recession. If you see Treasury's go up, and bond yields go up, that's the sign of inflation time. Which, makes sense? Alright, cool. Okay, let's do one more thing with this one, and then we'll price this up, and then we'll be done for today. So each of you has to be out there. Just on the end of the day. Let's say, the current issue is just bond, and we're still working with this same bond. The current issue is just bond, and immediately, right after the issue, so we still have three years of maturity, this is just to keep the three of your maturity. Right after the issue is suddenly, the risk rate drops to what do they have? 2.5%. The risk rate drops to 2.5%. So we're not, it was 4.8. We issue the bond, it goes out there, and then suddenly the risk rate drops to 2.5%. What happens to the price of the bond? First of all, it's totally directionally what's going to happen to the price of the bond. It's going to go up. Why? Well, because it's just bearing it down, and so relative to the most risk of risk of gas, we're sending it, you know, the investor will money, because of that, and so that's the third bond. Yeah, exactly. We're still paying 6% coupon. We're still promising that. We're still giving 60, 60, 60, but the risk rate went down, and so the price of our bond is going to go up. How much is it going to go up back? Could we calculate that price? Yes, we can. How do we do that? Perfect, we got the beta. We did it. So beta is done. So what else do I need that? I've got the risk rate. I've got the market rate. So I want the yield to maturity, exactly. What's my yield to maturity? Now it's going to be 2.5 plus 0.53 times 5. Right? This is my risk rate. That's the beta on my debt. That's not going to change. We can't calculate that. And this is the market risk premium. The market risk premium change is the risk rate. Because that's greater than the market price. Yeah, good question. No. And the reason for that is, that's not obvious for me anything I said so far. But the reason for that is what really happens here is, the risk rate drops, probably because inflation expectations went down, and the market returns also going to drop when that happens. So they're going to move together like this. So that's going to stay a 5%. So it's not going to be close. The market always has a beta of 1. So what's my new cost of debt? Can you guess where you're going to use out? 5.15. 5.15. So we're going to actually calculate the price. But it is my new price going to be above or below par. Above par. Why does he know that? Because this is less than 6%. Less than the coupon. So before we were below par, because this was above the coupon, and now it's dropped precipitously, not because of anything to do with my company, but just because the risk rate fell. Inflate the expectations fell, all returns fell. And so that's going to push my price up, and see how you actually above par. How do I figure that out? I'm just going to go like this. Let me see what my price is. 60 divided by 1.0515 plus 60. The value of 1.0515 squared plus 1,016. The value of 1.0515 cubed. Just going to use the present value. That comes out to... I did it. I walked over here and I got through the last video. Of course, remember in bond pricing, they'll probably rate this. They'll probably rate that instead. Just too big that one. I don't know, that's a big question. I'm not sure. I can tell you that in knowing some bond, if you're company is part of it, it makes it easier to be a... Oh, 100% percent. Yeah. If you can tell what you can't simply consider something to be a thousand dollars. Yeah, it's really because, I mean, all of the bonds priced in lots of a thousand, like one bond is at that pay so I get a thousand. It's not always true though. It's almost always true. It's not always true. And like this, there are obviously 100% and we're going to be eligible to that. That's where the convention is going. I have an annoying security. Okay. Alex. Sorry, this is her. I hope I'm not going to go back here. But I'm confused why the... Marker and premium didn't change. We changed the risk. Yeah, yeah. It's really a question and this is what Silvan was asking. It looks like it should, because the risk is very low. Right. And the thing that I haven't told you and didn't really explain is the return on the market is also going to fall to that. Because this is a nominal return. Meaning it includes inflation. So inflation falls, then all my returns go down by that same. Okay. So in this formula, we only need to change that for... Yes. Marker is the risk. Marker is the risk. Marker is the risk. Marker is the risk. Right. Marker is the risk. So what is the risk and risk period go down? Usually when inflation expectations fall. So like... In thinking. Yeah, it means like right now... So this is a three-year bond, right? That original 4.8% includes my expectations for how this inflation was going to be over the next few years. Let's say I issued the bond, and right after that the Fed comes out with a new... or the VLS comes out with a new release, saying, prices have fallen much more than we expected. Then I was thinking we might have like 3% inflation over the next three years. And suddenly I actually think it's only even 1% inflation over the next few years. So I drew my risk-re-a-drops by that 2% point of thought. I do like that. In general, yeah, in general people like lower inflation. But honestly, inflation doesn't really matter in the long run. Because it's just a fake number. It's just nominal numbers. But that's a discussion we're holding. If I own bonds and a crazy falls, I love high. Because my price, go for 9.6 to 2.30, 2.022, I just made a whole lot of money. So I like that. If I own bonds, I like to want to inflation falls. And I hate it when it goes up. Because the opposite happens. Yeah. So if the risk-re-a-break is inflation plus invocations, how does it look at the... There's a change in inflation. Exactly the same as I actually said. Yeah. That would also affect... Yeah, it works around the market. The only reason why I'm saying it's probably inflation is in patience is pretty constant. And inflation changes all the time. The multiply-periods. Yeah. So is there a period of time where the price of the bond is actually not just an end. And people could buy the bond for its to the 102, or whatever. Yes. But as markets have gotten more and more developed, it's shorter, shorter than 10% goes. So when you hear about people trading in microseconds, is they're trying to front them on this thing, and they've been literally maybe gotten bonds, but in stocks, we've gotten to like microseconds. That's exactly what I'm saying. That's exactly what I'm saying. So if you already own the bond, you're not going to get too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what you love to get. You ever remember to get some trade. All right. Let's do one last quick example. You guys are okay with that. Switch to a stock. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay Right That's the question. Should I buy a visa stock? Give me the money. Okay. The visa is stored. It's been given a given end of about $2.36 per share. That means for every share of visa you own, you get $2.36 per year. That's kind of the story of people that they're doing. I've done a bunch of analysis on visa and we'll talk about what that analysis would look like later on. But I've done a bunch of analysis and I think the share price of visa next year, so this is a one. Remember now is always 10-0. So one would be next year. I think visa's share price next year is going to be $360. Okay. So this is, that's my best guess. And visa's beta, I went with this up yesterday, it's 0.92. Is that surprising? Again, these are the texture questions you should ask yourself. Is that a beta you expect for a company like visa? Yeah. Pretty much. Okay. What is visa's exposure to the market? All transactions. And so they should have a beta pretty close to one out of them. They do well. When people spend on it, they do poorly when people don't spend as much money, so they're just saying, you go right along with the rest of the market. Okay. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay. I was going to do this in two years just to make it work, but my bad. Okay. I went with this up as well. The two-year treasury rate as of yesterday anyway was 3.57%. What price are you willing to pay for visa today? 10 zeros. Okay. So let's say you're only going to hold it for two years and then you're going to sell it. So how do I set up this? I actually want to get you guys work on this, but you only have two minutes. So we have time to link for this. Are we missing a value? Missing a value? And market risk premium. Oh, market risk premium. Let's just stick with the 5% market risk premium I've been using today. It's down here. Yeah. Market risk premium is 5% decision. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So just for the second time, I'm going to just start solving this. I know what bit of you guys in my time. Okay. So you're one. I'm going to get $2.36 in dividends. You're two. I mean, you get $2.36 in dividends plus the share price. I'm going to sell it in you two. So those are my cash flows. And then I'm also going to need a discount rate. How do I get the discount rate? I just want to go back to the cap-back. So I'm going to start with my risk for your rate of 3.57%. I want the two-year share rate because it's a two-year investment. I've got a beta point in 2 times 5. That comes out to you. Someone have a 8.17. 8.07. 1.17. 1.17. Okay. That's my discount rate. So what should the price of V6 today be? 2.36 divided by 1.08.7 plus 362.36 divided by 1.0817. If I do that, I think you come out with 311. 311.7. So V6 is trading below that. It's been I should buy it. If it's trading above that, then I shouldn't buy it. It turns out V6 is trading at like 340 or was yesterday after then. So I wouldn't buy it. I'd say that's a bad investment. This is like how you would price a stock. Now, of course, all of the magic here is where you come up with this number. Most people have no clue. But that's the OI-Vraw magic I'm from. But if you did know this number yet, so an estimate of that number, this is the way that you would price a stock. It's exactly the same way it's pricing. You can bond or pricing it. The cash flows divide that. If I want to close the discount rate. I know that was maybe a little bit quick, but I think I'll put the 3 simple examples. Last question. You didn't pay dividends. That's right. So a lot of stocks don't pay dividends. Even simpler. It's just 360 divided by 1.0817. Yep. Let's see each other. That's it. I hope that was helpful. I hope you guys have a good day. See you next week. One week."
