  "text": "Okay, guys. I am so excited about you here. You're a much more intimidated group when you're all together. It's only fair to say, like, I am a sort of you. So, it's like, what do you think, right? As far as the green pack, the green pants is actually color-foney. Okay, a couple of quick announcements, and then we're going to dive kind of straight into today. So, Callum said, two is due to right. It's due right now. I think all of a sudden we're going to turn it in. Corporate Becca is the only T.H.T.A. who showed up at my wedding. So, she will almost surely not have all of them graded by the end of the class. So, we'll get those next class. I will post solutions this afternoon, though, so you can start looking at solutions for that problem. Thank you. You're welcome. And then, what else we're going to go on? We have our next case is Thursday, right? Our next case is this coming Thursday. So, make sure you're working on that. The first class of the class today is going to be super helpful for that case. Hopefully the problems that wasn't well. So, that's on Thursday, and then next week we have a class on Tuesday, and then we have the midterm Wednesday Thursday Friday. Sorry, yeah, Wednesday Thursday Friday in the testing center. So, we won't have class on Thursday at the next week. So, that's what's going on there. I think I gave you all the information on the midterm, but I had to give you a last class. But, do you guys have questions about the midterm I need to give? I will. I will. You will, but not now. But, after you take it, you're not. There are no questions here. Why do you have midterm today? No, midterm is not today. Okay, no, no, no, no. Midterm is the next end of next week. Okay. Yeah, end of next week. I don't really know if we can give it to us, but this is your... No. I'm a QQ. There's the homie team. No, QQ. There we go again. There's no QQ. You're going to need to memorize the formulas. I posted the review sheet on Canvas. Hopefully you saw that. That adds on to everything that you need to know for the midterm. Yeah. Sorry. Can we get the calculator? Yes. You should bring it back to the point where you need to find the actual calculator. Just any calculator you're comfortable with. If you don't want to calculate it, you can borrow them from the testing center. So feel free to do that. I use it for reading my own research and I want comfortable with it. But whatever you want to do is find it anywhere. For it. Yeah. So I think you're on Canvas. You have problems that three do on. It's actually... Okay. Yeah, I just get a mention of that. So problem set three, I'm going to post it this afternoon as well. You will not need to turn that in. I think if it is review for the midterm. Okay. So problem set three, it is... It's just the timing this semester didn't work out that it made sense for me to make you turn it in. But problem set three covers material that will be on the midterm. Okay. So do problems set three, but you don't need to turn it in. I will post it today with checkpoints. And then I'll give you... My client is very early on in my end. But it will be a best way to do it. Okay. I will post it today with checkpoints. And then I will post solutions in like three or four days or something to that. So you can like... We're going a little bit... I know you guys can't run on or whatever, but like... Maybe sometime like this weekend I'll post like solutions to problems set three. So you have that to stay in your phone. But you don't turn in problems set, so you can put it in the mastermind and find it. So you know that as well as it's all clear. Okay. Good. Awesome. Other questions? Yes. This section is wonderful. We're going to find out. I've been magic. Oh. Sorry. I know. Let's see what else. Sorry. Hold up. Hold up. We need to start here. Just keep your hands. Okay. So... Okay. Okay. Um... Okay. What else? Any other last questions? We've got a lot of material to cover today, so I'm wearing my green pants. I'm wearing my green pants. I have some legendary green pants. Got the green pants? Here. Yes. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I still do not think about it. I just get it for the morning and I put on pants. And then I walk in here and like, oh, I look like a green pants. I guess I'm wearing my pants today. Yeah. You need more of that here review session. Oh, I'm not going to do any review sessions for the midterm. Um... I'm not going to do any review sessions for the midterm. I'm going to think of the problem sets as your review material. And then you've got lots of TA office hours and I would recommend going to them with any specific questions that you might have. Um... So, yeah, that's the plan. I might do a review session before the final. I have done that sometimes in the past, but I won't be doing one for that. I'm going to pull that on. What's that? Well, that one, right? Did I might do it? Sure. All right. That's it. Yeah. I'm willing to be bound by that weird content. Okay. All good? Yes. Sweet. Okay. So, um... Okay. No whiteboard in here, but I'm going to start on a whiteboard. So I'm just using... Oh, by the way, I'm recording this on Zoom as well, so might as well say. I'm not yet posted anywhere probably, but I've descended to people who could be here at the night 30 classes. I'm going to write on here for my whiteboard today. And here's where I want to start. We're going to spend maybe the first 20 or 30 minutes reviewing some whack concepts so that we make sure we have those like down all the way. And then we're going to switch over to talking about financial statements. And think about what financial statements tell us about it. Okay. Sound good? Yes, sir. All right. So, here's where we're going to... Oh, by the way, you thought my handwriting was bad on the board? Wait till I have to do that here. It's like you don't work. So buckle up. If you can't read anything, please just tell me. I'm not going to be offended by products. So, we've got this thing. What? It's pretty good. That's it. I already screwed up. But who did you just do that? I was just like, you just slide right. Wow. Okay, we've got that thing, right? What's this thing called? Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. I'm going to move this count rate that we might use if we're valuing what? Yeah. Like a whole firm or a project that didn't affirm. And there were three things I wanted you to remember about this formula. I'm just going to say them really facts, okay? But like, these are important things. One, the assets on this left hand side caused the returns that we see on the right hand side. We have to use the returns on the right hand side to back into the summer so they don't get to observe R a. But the causality goes left to right, not right to left. Two, we're always going to use market value of equity in this formula. So, when I'm actually leaving that E in the numerator over there, and the E that goes in the denominator, remember V? What's V? V is just debt plus the equity. The E's are always market value of equity. So, don't get mixed up and grab the book value of equity from the balance sheet. That's not what you want. Price of the stock multiplied by number of shares, okay? And number three, this is called a lever on lever formula, because we're taking two lever returns. This is a lever return. This is a lever return. What does the lever return mean? It's affected by leverage. That's all we need by that. It's affected by leverage. The more leverage I have, or the less leverage I have, is going to change R, D, and R, D. But the magic of this formula is, I take two lever returns, and I get an unlevered return, meaning a return that is not affected by leverage. So, no matter what level of leverage I have on the right hand side of this equation, R, A is going to be exactly the same. And that's going to be really important, for the example I'm going to show you right now. And hopefully this will start to seek you on the other side. Okay? But those are the three things you need to know about this. Okay? Question about this, which makes it standard, people with a third one is just be clear. Yes. This is a lever on lever formula. And it takes two lever returns on the right hand side, and weights them appropriately together on a lever return. So, no matter what leverage is on the right hand side, we're always going to get the same answer in the right hand side. Yeah, I can copy. I'll be like an English question, mostly. But why can you be better expected by leverage? If I, for example, if I increase my leverage, meaning I increase my debt and reduce my equity, what that's going to do is going to increase my cost of debt, and it's going to increase my cost of equity. If I decrease my leverage, meaning my debt to my ratio goes down, that's going to reduce my cost of debt and reduce my cost of equity. Does that make sense? So, that's all I mean is that if I change my debt to equity, you next in my firm, it changes a little bit. But the magic is, the magic is, no matter what I do, this RAA is, whoops, I see, that it would be. And this RAA is always going to see the same. The magic will happen. Either with a couple of other hands over here? No? Yeah, you can try it, Jen. To be over the, like, the elimination, all of the equal one. Yes, they will always equal one. For one half that I, either can get with equity or debt, that's what you like. Exactly. Yes, perfect. But it's not from the balance sheet. No, but it's. But it's kind of like a balance sheet. It's a market value balance sheet. That's what it is. Yeah. When do we use this versus why? I mean, you get that right now actually. Yes. With the letters, whenever RT, those are, RTs always move. Yes. Yes, but the way to move inversely from each other, is things. So, in general, it sounds like you don't need to have extra trends in distinct intercom and intercom for the stock, unless it's like given that there's only if I actually get to the situation in the problem. But in general, we're going to just put all equity together in one big pile and all of that together in one big pile. Even though we know really there's like, fake loans and bonds and different types of debt and there's convertible bonds and all that stuff. We're going to ignore that and just do it. Yes. Just because I'm very glad you've sat on this year and you're answered. Uh-huh. We just thought that they were in urge, but I thought you were just thinking, can you just explain your relationship to all of that? Yes, for sure. So, the rhetoric is remember work. If I increase my leverage, if I increase my leverage, by definition that means the debt to buy ratio can go up, because I'm increasing the leverage. And by definition my equity to buy ratio can go down. Those always move the gamers of each other. So, wait. The RT and the RT always move the same way. They either both go up or they both go down. Okay. That helped. Yep. Yep. I just want to make sure I'm understanding everything. I get a little confused being like, the finance we're going to be like, the accounting formulas. So, when we're talking about return debt, we're not talking about all my abilities that would appear on the account. It's just specifically like, our commercial papers are long term debt. But those kinds of things are... Anything that's an interest rate. Okay. And is that the reason why it accounts payable? That's payable and not included in that. And then on the equity side, we're not including anything like retainers. And it's just like, external capital through stocks. Yeah. And the equity side, we're literally going to take the stock price and multiply by numbers. So, comment effort. Yes, but typically we're just getting ignore preferred. Because it's usually a tiny sliver if it exists at all. Most firms don't have to regret. Maybe I should take that problem off this problem. So, you guys get really obsessed with preferred equity. The point of that problem on the problem set is to just help you understand the words that like, you could separate these things out and they each have their own returns and the weighted average of all of them is going to be R.A. That's the whole point of that question on the problem set. I'm not going to ask you about preferred equity on the exam. It's not on the exam. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Usually I don't say things like that, but you guys feel like really, really nervous about preferred equity. Okay, let's talk about wack now. So, this is not wack. This is the lever and lever formula. Wack is almost the same thing though, right? Remember what wack is. And you use this intro and get it under. I'm going to use this simple to find wack. Yes, exactly. Right? So, wack, the traditional way people write wack is like this. This is the one minus, that little thing is the tax rate. That's supposed to be a little tau where they start with the D. Usually this is how people write it. Yeah. I love that. So, if you open up a textbook, almost for sure they're going to write wack this way. But if I do a little bit of algebra, I multiply this stuff out, I can rewrite wack like this. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, let's do this, right? Sorry. What do we have here? You do have however you want. As long as you get the right answer. But, so all I'm doing is I'm just multiplying out through that parenthesis and then rearranging the equation. Now, why would I do that? I'm going to do that because what's this thing right here? That's R a. Whoa. Right? That's R a. So, now, last time I got to this point with section one and I did get this point with section two. So, section two is like holy crap and section one is like, why are you guys so dumb? It's just because I was too slow in section two. It's my battle, okay? So, that bit down there is R a. So, what's going on? R a, I'm going to tell you right now, R a is a real discount rate. It's accounting for time and risk and it's accounting for that in the right way. Wack is a real discount rate minus sell this. Minus this other bit. Those do you have section one? Why am I subtracting off a little bit? We talk about this a little bit right in the class. That has a tax shield. And you'll reconsider that. Exactly. Dead has a tax shield. What does a tax shield mean? Why is dead have a tax shield? So, I want to explain that for those who have earned it yet. So, if you're going to try to send less companies to have more debt so they grow as a company, it's like a little bit of a get back. Yes, exactly. Right? Go ahead. Now, essentially when companies pay taxes, it's based off of net income. And you get that income after you take out the taxes for the interest expense on debt. So, therefore, you're not actually paying in the taxes based off of the interest from the debt. But you do pay taxes for the interest of the tax. Exactly. So, if I think about you guys have seen income statements with Jake, if I think about an income statement, I've got revenues. Minus cost of goods sold, minus operating expenses. And that's going to give me like my... Even... I guess I might be even tough. Sure, whatever. I'm not in the camera. This is a crucial thing. I take out interest payments, interest expenses. I might take out appreciation as well. So, I'm going to get here by pre-tax earnings. Then I pay taxes. And then I get net income. Henry's getting worse in order since we go. Okay. And then, after I get my income, I might decide to pay dividends at that point. Did it go to whom? Cheryl. Where do I pay my debt holders? Ah, I'm paying my debt holders. It's up here. So, I pay my shareholders after I pay taxes. I pay my debt holders before I pay taxes. And what that means is the more debt that I have, the less taxes I pay. And this is called the debt tax shoot. And we'll talk more about this debt tax shoot later on in the course. I'm just introducing the idea to you now. We're going to talk about what does this tell us about how much debt you should use or shouldn't use in their simplification. So, that's just like foreshadowing. I learned this in my story to the classic. Okay. But for now, the only thing you need to know is that is tax advantage. The more debt I have, the less taxes I pay. And do we like paying taxes? No. No. Do we hate the government? I'll let you write into that one. We do like what the government does, but we'd rather not pay for it, right? So, we'd prefer not to pay taxes to their $1 taxes. I pay as a dollar, I can't give back to my debt holders or my equity holders. Right? I would rather not pay those taxes. And so, I should have more debt in that world. I should have more debt. In a world where the government gives his taxes. So, all of that is to say what WAP does, if I scroll back up here now, what WAP is doing is it's saying, let's take a real discount rate, and then let's pay taxes. No, we're going to adjust for the tax shield. We're going to adjust that discount rate down a little bit to account for the fact that the more debt I have, the less expensive it is for me. This has nothing to do with discount rates. And this is where, as a professor, a kind of heatwack is really useful, and we're going to use it in those reasons why it's useful. But pedagogy, we, it doesn't give you the right intuition, because it's a real discount rate, and then we do this little other thing that has nothing to do with discount rates. It's all about the fact that debt is tax managed, and we mow that down a little bit. Yeah, yeah. So, like, the number of clicks you're kind of like confused is because, like, you're saying that the real return rate is less, because I have taxes, but I'm advantageous because... Yes. So, think of it this way. RA is, I mean to say it two different ways, the same thing two different ways, which everybody clicks for you is great, but... One way is that RA is the cost of assets, is how costly it is to me to buy assets. The more debt I use, the less costly it is to me, because I get tax advantage. So, that's why it comes, why the wax comes down. Because it's less costly to use debt because of this taxes. You also think of returns, not as return for costs. Yes, this is the return to required stores. Exactly. And those are not being the same thing. For me, as the CFO of my company, they're costs for my investors their return. I'm paying them to give me cash right now, so that I can go use it to my fund. So, their return is my cost. Okay. The second way to say is this. Remember, where we're headed with all of this? Oh, I'm trying to get my money back. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're going to put it on the box. That's the wax. So, this is the formula we're going to use to value a firm or a project or an investment burden. We're going to use this formula over and over and over again. Right on this. Right now we're just going to be understanding that this is our down here in the denominator. But if you're ever buying a project or a whole firm, that's the formula you're going to use. And what we're doing is our cash flows don't have protection. And instead, we account for the tax show of end-to-dynamic. There's a reason why we do that and we don't need to worry about the reasons right now. I'll tell you after we've been there. You've got enough time to go into your right-wing. But what I want you to know right now is simply this. And this is the other way to say the same thing. What we're doing is we're telling the lie in the numerator because we don't have our actual cash flows, it's our actual cash flows, except we don't account for the tax show there. It's almost our actual cash flows. And then what we do is we tell another line, the denominator, to account for that first line that we told you. And those two things cancel each other out, particularly, you get the right answer. This is the only answer for two lies made in truth. That is the number one. You find out? You've been lying. Two lies made in truth. That's really, and what I actually mean by that is, we all know that this is what we're doing. I'm not actually lying. I'm actually not asking for anyone. But it turns out to be easier to value a firm this way if I account for the tax show in the denominator. But the tax show is a cash flow, not a discount rate. It is cash I have not paid to the government. It is cash that I get instead. You're not paying the tax show. The tax show, that money that I have not paid to the government, that's a cash flow. And in a perfect world where professors are happy and practitioners are happy, we would account for that in the numerator. But it turns out to be a little bit tricky to account for that in the numerator. And it's easier to say, you know what? We're going to pretend there's no tax show when we get the cash flows. And instead, we're going to bump down our discount rate a little bit. So our cash flows in the numerator are too low. But the discount rate is also too low. And those offset each other perfectly when we get the right answer. Okay? That's what's going on here. We'll talk more about that right after the measure. So you don't need to like fully grasp that at the moment. What I do think you should grasp is the wax is Ra minus the tax show. Joke. So Ra is the interpretative. It's the noteback. The wax. Ra has no tax from taxes. That's right. And Ra doesn't depend on my leverage. My tax show does. So wax is not the same on our leverage issues. But Ra is the same, in my way, the leverage. You know how I question these purposes? We never really use Ra. Anywhere. It's not really an impact reference. So we really use Ra. I'm going to show you exactly where Ra now. We use it because we're going to use comparable firms to find some information. We're going to find Ra. And then we're going to adjust for my wax. I see. I'll show it in a second. I'm just going to ask if you would ever be a Ra. If you're putting your product on the leverage, and not in the car. Not if there's still fun to do with debt. Okay. Suppose I am an all-equity firm. What's true about Ra and wax? It would be a big problem. Just say exactly the same, because debt to value was the zero. So that tax yielder just when it goes away, which makes sense. I don't have any tax yield. I'm all that being said. There's no debt. There's no tax yield. So in that instance, wax and Ra are the same. As soon as I add a dollar of debt, they start to differ. From wax is going to be lower than Ra. And it's always lower than Ra. Jackson. So you need to say wax is for a project or another project there. From what is a project the store you were going to want from? Is that change wax? Change it is what I'm going to want. Is a short-term cost of debt and a short-term cost of debt. And that would be our RD Army. Yes, exactly. So just remember where I get RD and RE from. That's where I used to kept that. So if I'm doing a short-term project, I want a short-term risk-free rate. If I'm doing a long-term project, I want a long-term risk-free. That's where it's going to come into play. For the liberal level formula, you use the data instead of the formula that's still working with data. For those still works with data. So you can find the asset data and then use the cap-m to convert that to an RA. You're good to go. You can use the exact same as the cap-m of the data instead. Yeah, this is the lever and lever formula right here. You can replace all the R's of data. That means it still works just great. So if you prefer that way. I prefer to work in R. Yeah. If they want to do that, you can just do data instead of R. Okay, so typically. Just remember this. You almost always are going to get an equity data and a debt rate. You have to convert one to the other. I just prefer to go equity data to equity cost of that. That would be great. And then use this formula. But if you want to convert this debt rate to a debt data and then do it with data, you can do that. I just want to make sure I understand correctly. So if you did that and you put everything in beta, was it going to be getting the data assets in your net? You used cap-m to convert that to the regular net? No. It's one extra step. Do companies buy equity on debt? Do companies buy equity using debt? Yes. Exactly. So when I say leveling up, that's actually what I mean. What you would do is you would issue a new bond. So I give you a certificate. And you give me a bunch of money. You're now my debt holder. And I take that money and I buy stock. So I issue my debt to buy back stock or I'm issuing equity to pay back my debt. That's what we need by leveraging it on the market. Okay, let me show an example. I think it's going to clarify a lot of this. You've said it, for example. Yes. It's going to start to get order. It's going to start to get work practical as theoretical. Basically, for sure. Okay. Yeah. That's all I need. So let's go. I mean, stop screen sharing and here. And we're going to do something on the computer. I really hate the setup of this screen. I'm going to stand over here. I'm like the man behind the curtain. Why are you saying that? I've had a question about standard deviation. Go for it. Right now, we're going to touch much of standard deviation. Or set there just one question that's really, it was a loop, not a loop, but it was like a three-unil loop. I'm going to now hear the doctor. The question is, do you infer this? Yeah, the re-unil loop is like, oh, yeah, beta, which has more, can fluctuate your return on. Like what you actually get. And standard deviation doesn't necessarily exist. But standard deviation is brisk. So standard deviation is brisk, but it's a measure of what risk? Standard deviation is total risk. Systematic and idiosynology. Yeah, that's good. Beta is the measure of just systematic risk. So in that question, on the problem set, the whole point of that question was to help you remember that a start could be really, really risky in a total risk sense, but still have low systematic risk. In that question, there's one start that had a high standard deviation and a low beta, and the other start had a low standard deviation and a high beta. And the high beta start is going to be, is going to have a higher return. Not the, because it's the beta that matters, not the standard deviation. Are you excited? Yes, I'm not. Perf. Okay. Let's say, let's say I work for Johnson and Johnson. And I work for their medical devices division, and we're considering launching a new project. We're going to develop a few medical devices. But we're going to need a wax to determine if we should invest in this thing. I need a discovery for that. Do I want to use Johnson and Johnson's wax for this? No. I don't. Why not? Because they do think under the name medical devices. Exactly. Johnson and Johnson's overall wax is a combination of all the different things that Johnson and Johnson does. What do they do besides medical devices? You can't do oil. I don't know. I don't know. Johnson does everything. Every time he's throwing a Johnson and Johnson is doing something. So I don't want to use their wax, because that's going to give me the aggregate combined wax with everything Johnson and Johnson does. I want the wax for medical devices, to represent the riskiness of medical devices. Does that make sense? Yes. So what I need is a pure play public comparable to birth. All that means is that a public firm where I can get data, that just does medical devices, and they don't do anything else. That's what I want. And I'm going to use their data to try to estimate a wax for medical devices. Because medical devices have a certain amount of systemic risk, and that's the thing that I want. Which you get to medical devices have more or less risk than, like lotion. Medical devices? That's why. Systematic risks. And less systematic risks, right? So we're going to have, because people still use medical devices even in recessions. People buy a little less lotion in recessions though, right? That's one of the things that can like do with that. Well, I do do that. Right? Plus seven. Okay. So that's the idea. Okay. Is I don't want to just use Johnson-Caston's overall, because I'm going to mix it together, riskiness, and a whole bunch of different things. So, when you are really doing real life, as I was finding, is many public firms that only do medical devices, and do this process we're going to do for all of them. I was just going to do it for one for Boston Science Institute. Boston Science Institute is a public company that mostly does medical devices. So they are, hopefully, a good comparable firm, where I can go look up information about them, and use that to estimate the whack for Johnson-Caston medical devices. So just, you can shout out to me, what's the information I'm going to need data? I need a data. Okay? Marking. I'm leveraging real risk-free range. Good? Marker is premium? Excellent. Tax rate? I'm getting back. I'm getting back. I'm getting back. Later, I'm going to want to borrow it. I'm dead. Look value. Look value. Look value. Look value. Dead? Excellent. And I need a, you'll make sure you're dead. You need a cost of debt. I don't want to, you got to borrow money. Hold on to some information I get in here. Let's just start linking this stuff up. And I'm going to look this up importantly. I'm going to look this up mostly for Boston Science Institute. There's one thing up here that matters only for Johnson and Johnson. What is it? Tax rate. The tax rate. I don't care about Boston Science Institute's tax rate. I care about Johnson and Johnson's tax rates because we're the ones that get the tax rates. So let's just say I go to my account and I talk to them and they say our marginal tax rate is 25%. So that's basically just given to me. And there's one other thing, I'm just going to highlight this, is being this is just for Johnson and Johnson. There's one other thing that only matters for Johnson and Johnson. It is Johnson and Johnson's target leverage ratio. And what I mean by that is how much leverage are we going to use for this medical device in the project? So I go and I, you know, maybe I'm going to see a phone and I just decide that. I go talk to my team or whatever. Let's just say for my project we decided we're going to use 30% debt to value of the share. I mean, I come back to those two things in a second. But for all the silly stuff I need to go look this up up. So let's do that. Is this going to, is that going to be sharing? Am I, oh I don't think I was sharing that. I apologize to people who are watching or who are doing the same. Well you guys will see it. But it's, I'm recording this on Zoom because there are a few people who couldn't come to the fast right hand. But now they can see it. So Zoomers? That's what we're doing. Zoomers? Let us chat. Yeah. Okay. So let's go to... We're going to come here. I typically just use Yahoo Finance. Yahoo Finance works just as well. I know that's a little small on the screen. This is made right here is 0.61. So I'm going to grab that. This is Hood Beta. I know. Awesome. Thanks to Hood Beta. And I need one other thing from here. I want their market cap right here. That says 142.582 billion. That's the way it is. Billion dollars. So I'm actually, I don't need to grab their share price because Yahoo Finance already just showed me the market cap straight up. That market cap that they're showing me is the share price and multiply by number of shares. But if you don't have market cap, you would multiply those two things together. Okay. Marked by the equity gives market cap to the same thing. Okay. I've got those two things. I'm always just going to tell you what market was premium to use. Let's just go with 5%. And I happen to look up the risk of you reading up very long ago. Well, I will just look up again and won't take her. Okay. Current treasury rates. I will have the 30 year because this is going to be a long term project. 4.76%. Okay. Good? Yeah. Question so far. Is that the beta, the equity beta? That is their equity beta. Yes. I'm going to take that. Okay. Yes. We chose box scientific books just because they only do medical boxes. Yes. We and the other right here are advertising. So the ideal key is they create the tax-pecker medical device, the weird consistency. In practice, there's this gray area, right? You want the more cops you have, the better. But the more cops you have, usually the less similar they get to meet. And you're just trying to balance those things. That's the trade-off. This is where it's more of our impact to that one. But this polarity is just in the business. What we want is that they have similar systematic risk jobs. And we're basically what I'm assuming is, well, they make medical prices. Their systematic risk is probably similar to a weaving mode. That's going to work. Yeah. Can we make an assumption, no, like Johnson Johnson, the box scientific size, that maybe they have more risk than we would, but that's okay. Yeah. Yes. But importantly, remember, well, remember two things, first of all, what we actually care about is systematic risk. Sist-major risk doesn't vary with size, nearly as much as you might think. It does vary with size, a little. But it's not like big firms have more systematic risk, or less as my experience, small firms. Not by that much, to be honest. So it's industry that matters way more than size. And secondly, remember, what we want to justify is risk. Oh, this medical device, we might be creating by Johnson Johnson, which is actually probably what's small of the loss in some of the things that we've done. Does that make sense? Okay. Yes. Our credit rate is not all good. Not for the risk we create. Because risk we create is risk-free. So we don't care about credit rate at all. What we are going to care about is they cost of debt. This yield to ensure you don't get debt. So let's grab that for Johnson Johnson. So I googled this right before class. I just googled Boston Scientific Current Bond yields. Now here's one bond. But this note comes due in 2028. Right now it's 2025. So it's a three-year bond. Is this the one we want? No, why not? It's short term. It's short term. It's going to reflect short term inflation expectations and things like that. I want to launch your bond because it's a long-term project. So I'm just going to scroll down here and conveniently, business insider lists some other bonds from me here. Here's one that I mature is in 2049. That's pretty good. That's about as far out of we're going to get. We're talking about 23, 24 years from now. That's about as long as you're going to find in corporate bonds. And conveniently, they list the yield right there. Now, why is the coupon different from the yield? Because the market has changed. When they issued the coupon on the yield were probably almost exactly the same. Since then the market has changed. So I want to grab that yield with 5.36%. Okay. All good? So I've got their cost of debt. I've got an equity beta. What do we do now? I need a little bit more information. I'm going to need to use some formula. What do you guys want to do first? It actually doesn't matter to me. So you can't bet. Let's find RE. Four Boston Sanctivitis. So what do I have? I have the risk-free rate plus their beta. What you're going to play by? The market is free. So I've got a cost of equity done. I already have a cost of debt. Sorry. I'm just using the cap in there. So the risk-free rate plus beta is going to spend more than three minutes. That's just the cap. So I've got a cost of equity. I already have a cost of debt. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a weighted average of those two things. To find RE using Boston Sanctivitis information. And then I'm going to assume that that RE is the right cost of assets for medical devices. And then I'm going to apply that to Johnson and Johnson. So almost there, what other information do I need still? Just people who have been information. Who have been information. Where do I get that from? Balance sheet. Balance sheet. So, I'm going back here. I like to use capital IQ. This is capital IQ. Let me make it a bigger portion. You all have access to capital IQ through BYU if you want it. I have a little sheet that I can put on canvas. It gives you instructions for how to sign up for an account. Let me just show it real quick here. Capital IQ is awesome. It pulls their SEC findings for me. And I've got balance sheets right in there. So, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go to, I see let's look at Boston Sanctivitis. Oh, look at that. I just did. And I'm going to go to balance sheets. See there's some financial evaluation balance sheet. I like to put the weight on the left. Go. Is my balance sheet? I've won as of June 30th, 2025. That's my most recent balance sheet. So, that's what I'm going to use. Okay? Let me scroll down a little bit. You guys tell me. You don't need to log. What number is going to I want to grab off of here? I don't think you want to. Okay, launch your debt. Good. So, I've got that 10.981. These are in millions. Remember my market cap was in billions. So, I'm going to put this all in billions. So, 10.981, launch your debt. You guys see that number out there? Yeah. Okay, do you need that number? Do I need anything else? I don't need a portion. I don't need another one. I'm not going to. I'm not going to. And in this case, they don't have any short-term debt. But if they did, I would grab it for sure. Remember, all you need to do is you're going to look at the balance sheet. You're going to run down the liabilities. And anything that hasn't interest rate you want to get. So, accounts payable. Don't have an interest rate. We don't care about this. Leases don't have interest rates. We don't care about this. Other approved expenses. We don't care about those. So, in this case, I'm just going to grab launch your debt, current portion of launch your debt. Yeah. Something's not passing the centess. Right here. Didn't we just look at the rate here? We looked at the return fund. I guess three years is not the short term. We looked at a 25. We did look at a three-year end. We said we don't want to use that as too short. But yeah, but that's three years old. It wouldn't be current. It wouldn't be a short term. It's still a good long term. Right. That's one of the good ones. I'm just thinking, we, we, just, just guess how debt is value. Let's equate your value. It's mostly bull money. Yes. In this case, I'm assuming value was like the asset side of the balance sheet. You can think of it as the market value of their assets. I see. Okay. It's not going to equal the book value of their assets. No, you're right. Actually, no, that way. Okay? That's why we're using short term debt to go to the number one. We want all of the debt that they're using to fund themselves. And, um, because that represents, like, also remember this is current portion of launch and debt. But even if we have short term debt, we also want to include it. The reason why is, even if I have more short term debt, that increase is my cost of long term debt. Because it increases my risk. And I'm just trying to get, how much total debt would you use in your life? To sum my budget. That would be spent on the basis of the current rate. That's right. We only want you to matured for one long term bond. You've got that. Yep. Okay? So would you go over debt? All of the debt. So I mean, it grabs, I mean, it grabs this number right here. 10.91. Let me just put that in here. Looked by debt. I mean, put equals 10.91. And I'm going to add to it, if I go back here, the current portion of launch and debt, which is 0.48. And if I had any short term debt, which they don't, I would also add that in here. If they have something called notes payable, I mean, add that in under, because notes have interest rate. If they have, you know, sometimes different colors would put their balance sheet a little bit differently. But you just go through every line item. And if it says debt or bond or note, you're going to include it in short term or long term. All of it. Okay. But for this particular firm, that's it. No, it's payable, yes. It comes payable, no. Exactly. Exactly. You can't payable, you don't have an interest rate. Notes have an interest rate. So the words you're looking for, like, notes, loans, bonds, debt, anything that has those words in it. Yeah. So there's a different form of money. If you're just here looking at balance sheet, which is like the leverage ratio for the balance sheet, that's the beginning of the information here. It's going to include all liability. That's right. I don't want liability staff at work, just like I promised that. I have a recent short term. Yes. It's an interest period. Yes. And here's the reason why. Who do I think would be the investors in my company? Devilors? Exactly. That's it. I don't think of my suppliers who are lending me money through account payable as my investors. I'm not thinking about the interest. I'm only thinking about the return of the devilors. Return to my shareholders. So I only want debt that have gotten from devilors and had to be gotten from devilors. That's not a good idea. The purpose of forgetting the purpose of getting the value of the value of the value of the interest. Yes. I give you a debt to value of the ratio. I'm assuming it's this value. Okay. Okay. So I've got this. Now I'm just going to calculate these things. I mean, calculate my debt to value of the ratio. Actually, let's just do this. Let's calculate the first. That's literally just my debt plus my equity. I'll run the market value right there. Okay. So calculate my B. Book value debt plus my equity. My debt to value ratio then is debt to value. Equity to value is equity to value. Obviously. Okay. That makes sense? Yes. G-pass? No. Perfect. So now I can find R-A. That's just debt to value times my cost of debt. Plus equity value times my cost of equity. And if you want, I can put that in the present as term. Now this is where I like you take a quick pause. What is this? What is this number representing? What is the acid acid? Eric. The required rate of the return on the acid. On acid that produce medical devices. Exactly. And I'm using Boston Scientific. And what I'm hoping is that the medical device we're producing by Johnson & Johnson has similar systematic risk to what Boston's Scientific does. So I'm going to use this as my R-A for Johnson & Johnson. Because I have good public information on Boston Scientific. And that's the information I need. So, and this number, suppose Boston Scientific had way more leverage. What would happen to this number? Nothing. Because R-A doesn't change. If they would less leverage, nothing. Because what did we do? We unlearned their returns. They have one levered return of 5.36%. Another one of 7.8.1%. Those are both affected by leverage. And we've weighted them appropriately to get an unlearned cost of acid. Yep. Let's say in this self-right shooting, increased the amount of debt. Would we see that double change in 7.8%. No, because I would have to change a few things all the same time. In this game out of debt. But then the other thing is going to happen if my cost of debt can be borrowed. And my cost of the edg will be borrowed. And if I change all of those in the appropriate way, the way that the market would actually do that, my argument is this. Yep. So, let's say I want to buy an ICO. Explicitly, what's that? I would still use it. No, I would still use the wire because if we take it like double-check it through it, it's for increasing debt, which is a cost of energy in the public. And so, in the end, it still lives up to being equal to water. Yes. Exactly. Okay. Yep. We talked a little bit more about selecting call. Businesses are comparable businesses. It seems like quite some of them are industry, like the size of business or the brand value you can add or much. Yeah. So, the thing that we care about is the system address. It turns out, if you look at the data, that same industry is nothing that matters, like orders of magnitude more than anything. So, we'll take this focus on industry. Size of the firm doesn't really matter that much. If I look at a huge, whatever, shoe manufacturer and a tiny shoe manufacturer, they're really similar to the system address. It doesn't matter a little, but it's just not enough that I was aware about that much. And for the purposes of my class, I'm not going to ask you to select what's a good composite factor on it. I was going to say, use these constants. Because this is more or I can't really test on that. It's more or nothing in science. Yeah. So, we're looking at investing in the next new medical device. We would want the return on that for the seed that we're going to offer for. I would love for it to be higher than this. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. But that's like the minimum price. This is the hurdle rate. Exactly. This is the discovery that I need something better than that to make it work my time to invest. One way to take it is, I could take that chunk of money and build my own medical device. Or you know what I could do? I could invest in Boston scientific and to earn that return. Yeah. Yeah. So, for R-A-E, you use the lever on the bottom of your phone. Uh-huh. Where do you get R-E or what do you do? I just looked it up. I said, I went to Google and I said, current long-term bond yield for Boston scientific. Oh, it's a little wide-handed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we are doing the job. We know the CFO. Yeah. We are job-to-downs from the CFO. So, I mean, we want to turn around the house at 5,000,000. So, it's time for us to come and help. And, uh, if I could go, I would work. Yeah. Our job, what is our job? Our job, like needle-heat, is to max my shareholder level. So, I want to return to higher than this. If I get a bit lower than this, I've made my shareholder's mortgage. So, I'm going to do that. Yeah. So, we solve for Boston scientific fix. Uh, I'm going to do that. We have to use that, yes. I'm going to do it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. One more real quick. So, when you think I can return on asset, is that it comes out of the house? Yeah. I think that's the right thing. Um, yeah. Is it a company or our other partners, like, to go through my own. So, that's not like the best thing to stop. It's not like the overall home. Yeah. So, it's like, it's my own piece of money. Exactly. So, if I took my money, and I invested in Boston scientific stock, I would earn 7.81%. Yeah. That number right there. If I took my money, and I put 92% of it in the stock, and 7% of it in the debt, I'm going to earn 7.62%. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So, let's get to whack. We're almost there. This is the discount we don't want to use. But I'm going to end up using whack. I'm going to adjust this for my tax shield that I'm doing as Johnson and Johnson. So, I'm done using Boston scientific information. Now, I'm going to use my information. And what do I know about myself? Well, I know that we are going to use 0.3 leverage ratio, which is way higher than Boston scientific. Because I just like debt or whatever. I've chosen that number. And my tax rate is 25%. And I've also, this is something I forgot to write down before. I also need Johnson and Johnson's yielding security on debt. Which could be different from Boston scientific. Right? Let's say Johnson and Johnson's is, you know, 5.7%. They like to use a little bit more debt than Boston scientific so they're across the debt and higher. So, that stuff in yellow, that's Johnson and Johnson information. We don't use any of that until I get to this point when I found our aid. Now, I'm going to use Johnson and Johnson information to find whack. So, here's what I'm going to view. Let's actually make tax yield adjustment. Which is Johnson and Johnson's leverage. Sorry, multiply by Johnson and Johnson's tax rate. Multiply by Johnson and Johnson's cost of debt. And then, the whack that I want to use is simply RA minus that tax yield adjustment. Is that not said? This crossing the streams is repolling like our RA from another company's information. Yeah, an hour. It feels wrong, right? Yeah. It's because it, it, I'm glad that it feels wrong. Because it means you can't understand what we're doing here. What have I done? RA is the true display. Yeah, that's fine. I'm using Johnson's scientific, but I'm assuming that that would be the discovery for Microsoft as well. It's a similar thing. So, that's what our A is. And then, all I want to do is adjust for my tax yield. I don't care what Johnson's scientific does with my tax yield anymore. I only care about my tax yield. So, I'm using all of my information to calculate this number. No, Johnson's scientific research. Yeah. If you've had a finance class before and you've heard the term re-levering, this is re-levering. I'm, I'm accounting for my leverages, not Boston's scientific. I've taken Boston's scientific and un-levered it. And now I'm re-levering to account for my level of leverage. Does that make sense? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. So, let me say that it's hard to leverage your issues. And I'm just going to go by this company and use all of that to bring our ratio of what we're going to do back. And I'm going to start getting it. Yeah, I start getting me just to what Johnson and Johnson is planning on doing in the future. It's really tough. You're going to like, let me know if that's what you would end up getting. No, no, assuming that Johnson and Johnson, if they do this project, they're going to fund it. They're going to fund it with 30% dead, 70% of it's going to be. Yeah. I'm just having a hard time understanding why we want to use that at all. Because if we have the money, we don't necessarily have to invest it in a medical device. We can invest it somewhere else. So, I'm wondering why we're using that comp rather than like a highest yield that we could invest in. Yeah, okay. So, you're right. I can invest it somewhere else and I don't know how you're going to invest. In fact, one place that you're going to invest this is like put it in real estate and love that 99%. I mean, you're really high yield rate. Do we like that? Why not? I need a account for risk. Right? Yeah. This is a risk-adjusted return. Accounting for the risk-adjusted medical devices. So, this is my benchmark for this particular investment and I want to calculate, is it worth it to each investment and that thing adjusted for the risk-adjusted medical device? Yes. So, how long does that, the 7.6 degrees are they going to price in real-world medical devices? We want to use that in our current act. Yes. Exactly. And the reason that we use the COV to calculate RA and then we use our bonus real-electric to calculate the actual cost. Our survey is going to be unlearned. Like, it doesn't matter. And the outer metrics for death and value yields matured and tax rate. That is like integral to our time. Yes. Exactly. Yes. Yep. It's kind of the real-worldly, we look at multiple similar companies and find the whack of each one. Yes. We have to that, would you average that number or lower? You take the average of all the RA's. So, find RA for each column, then average those things. That's what you should do on the case. Yeah. You should measure death. Is that something that we have to calculate? I know you should hold it in front of the problem. Yeah. And that is what I can do in reality if I work for Johnson and Johnson. I'm going to see a vote. I do one or two things. One, I can just do some Johnson and Johnson's own two thoughts, just like I did. I just see if it's something. Or two, I call my anger and I say, can you see a vote of Johnson and Johnson? Suppose I have this between death and now, whatever you do. That's what I'm thinking. Okay. Yeah. I would go wrong if I, that's why I'm looking forward to it. I guess the number one we use by the way is the same. Is the same. Can you explain how an event like why you want to try to live in K2? It's a little bit different. Why I'm going to go like, oh, this part right here? What I'm doing here? Yeah, sorry. Okay. It's on your eye. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Can I switch back to the eye cut from that? I'm doing this first. I'm doing this in a way. I'm doing this. So, probably the way that you have seen how this is going to be here. And I'm doing some algebra and I'm doing it this way where I find R-A first. I found R-A first using boxes and different things. And then I just actually let's just see if there's any Johnson and Johnson. Do you use letter M? Yeah, yeah. Perfect. There's no cheat sheet. The cheat sheet is her head. Okay. Last question. Yes. How is J-J getting this letter to the hero? That's my job as the FO. So, medical devices comes to me and they say, hey, we want to start this new project. Can you help us decide we should invest in it? So, I say, yeah, sure. Look, in general, I kind of prefer like a 30% that's a value ratio. So, I'm going to use that in this calculation. And then, if I give them a green light, then I say, okay, how am I going to fund this thing? I'm going to issue some debt. And I'm going to use some cash or whatever I need to get to that 30%. So, basically, it comes down to the preferences. You can see it's a little bit of a city that's a little bit debt-funded or a bit of fever and gracious. You can. We'll talk more about that in November, actually. Because, yeah, there's some things that this misses in that. Yeah. Joe, you mean business? Joe, you're lying. Sorry. Yeah. It's like, okay, but it's okay. We're carrying light, but just say Johnson and Shepard. Boss is actually changing. It's a nice line. He's going to go around. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So, this might be not a broken thing. But, yeah, essentially, with this, we're seeing this transfer asset as a new consensus. So, we end up getting it at the same time as time to turn on. Then, would it be better to, if we anticipate that time has been lasting for the 30-year bond? And we know that we have to have to pull up the net at $1,000. And we say about to 7.2% annually to be able to pay off the bull at the end. Or, would it be better to save up the 10% now or save up the, say, 3% now and then 10% like a raw to be able to take care of the bull's team? That's all dependent on the market and the use of bulls. Basically, how risk, how nervous do you feel to see a bull, but rolling over that one? So, like, I can roll that over. I don't need to say what that means. Which, that's mostly what happens. And, we're working closely, we don't pay off. This issue will be fine. The only risk is, you try to do that in something that's a big question. You can't roll over. That's the needy. Okay, hopefully that's better by a lot of things. So, great. Okay? We've got, like, two minutes. So, I'm just going to tee up where our discussion will be, not next time, because we're going to the case next time. A week from today. Which is material that's on the mentor. Okay? Okay. Here's, I'm just going to tee it up really briefly, and it's like there in the back of your mind. Okay? So, this is like totally new topic. All we're going to do on that day, one week from today, is just get use of financial statements. A little bit. And think about what they tell us about the firms of the markets. Okay? If the problem's that three heads up on this as well. Here's how I'm going to tee it up. Get excited. You know what the baddest moment of the day. You guys see it well in the middle? How did she know? She's like, this is what you guys think. It's a girl lesson, right? Yeah, we have her. Could you eat your chestnuts? And she said, She's just saying, This is the right thing. I'm going to give you a little time. I'm going to give you a little time. Oh, you guys can tell me this. Here's my little diagram from the finance. You've learned about balance sheets, yes? Yep. You learned about income statements, right? Those are the only two we're ever going to use. And I'm going to give you a cashable statement. Where from this diagram is the balance sheet? By the time you're sure of it. I like to see a bomb wrap. I'm right corner. I mean, give you a little hint. If you're not on the bottom, it's top left. What's on the balance sheet? Passets. You can't start with passets. Where's the asset? I don't know. It's a whole lot of hair. That's what shows up on the balance sheet. How much did I purchase my assets for in the past? When I buy them. Where is the right hand set of balance sheets? Why? Where did I get the money from to buy those assets? So those top rows are the balance sheet. Where's the income statement? The bottom. The bottom left. The bottom left. The income statement. Where's revenue? The bottom. The bottom. So income statement is going to be all over here. We've got revenues, minus cogs, minus a bunch of other expenses. And I end up with a net. It's going to be a lot of money. So income statement is basically, it's all about the operations of the firm. It's the same over here. And we end up with basically not quite but really close net income being this arrow down. That's the money we get back out of our investment.
