And that's not going to be a late submit. So please submit it already. The original plan was that your problem set too is do next time. Again, we do the Heinz case the next time. And that's a week before today. Then we have two classes with nothing to do. And then we have the midterm. OK, that's the original statement. Here's what I'm thinking. What if we do problems that too do a week before today? Yes. We do. We do. We do the Heinz case so we can have from today. And I'll just switch the order of the lecture. So I'll do the financial statements lecture before the Heinz case rather than after. Yes. So that basically first goes to that semester. Yes. You know that? I'm going to submit the order. I can't see any issue of doing that. And I think that'll sequence it a little bit better so that I can cover back more fully and give you a link up for time. To learn back, do the problem set. Should we get a place? Let's do that. Let's get that. OK. So I'll just work. OK, so I'll make that change on canvas. And I'll make that one on canvas so it's really clear. But that's going to be the sequence. So nothing will be doing next time. Don't lower that into a false set security. This will still have problems that do a week from today. And then the Heinz case will be the next class after that. We can have from today. And then you'll have one week and then revenue. OK. Got it? We're going to do that. OK. Thanks for bringing that up. Yeah. Just maybe the TA question. But once we expect to have the wall-con case back, so we can use that feedback so it's a great general time. Oh, I don't have a great end night in our probably. You don't have a cover. You're all gone. No, we aim to have the grid in with it roughly a week. But it actually is a lot of work to grid the cases. So I'm hoping to be with Rebecca who's creating some of them and Joseph is creating some of that this time tomorrow. I haven't come back from Joseph to see if he can. So I can get him started and then go to the other side. So I know that's not a lot of meat times the next case. But it's kind of the rest of the work. Yeah, other questions? No? Do they're good? OK. It's tough. It's not easy. OK. OK. It's morning. All right. OK. Here's what we're obviously going to do the wall-con case today. Here's how I do cases quickly. Obviously, it's a lot more participation from you guys. And how I'll get things going is I will always just draw two people out from here. And just to get the case started. And basically, I want you to tell me, kind of, who will come in is what are they trying to do? Just some of them like the basic details. So the first person I draw out a little first, the person can have a back to clean up a little bit. Like any other things that you can do. For no. So I'm going to draw those things out right now. And then those people will get a couple of minutes to think about they can gather their thoughts. And then I'll talk about what one has to do for the quiz. And then they'll have to go to Brad. Brad, Brad. Brad, you'll get to go first. So you're going to tell us who is where we come. What are they trying to do? What are some of the main issues we see in the case we're going to need to address today? And then I've got Alex and Wyne. Not Alex. This Alex is right there. You'll kind of go second. So whatever Brad doesn't cover, you can kind of like, be ready after. You can't do it. I'll leave you guys since we haven't had cases before. And I know that's sort of like sort of out of the book. You guys just a couple of seconds to gather before we dive in. So in terms of like we're in the course, we're getting close to endowment discount rates. So like, we're going to do this case today. We're going to price bonds. We're going to think a lot about discount rates. Next time we're going to talk about applying discount rates to a whole firm rather than just a bond that is stock. It's all the same concepts. It's just we're combining some of them together, basically. We'll do that problem set in the hinds case that really solidify that. And then we're done with discount rates. And we finally like gotten through the hardest part of the course. And then after that, I seem to get a lot more practical like what they had to be. How do we use this? So I'm trying to get a little hope. So that's kind of where we're at. And just my course. Um. How are you going to do that? You're ok? Still unemployed. Is that what you're doing? That's a good bit of work. That's not all. This is over here. I know we just had an actual black. It was a rather tumultuous weekend. A lot of ways. Is it fun to check it in? You guys are all right? I am. It could be better. No, never. Sort of like stalling on grass for half and half. And how it's supposed to have. But if you've got this a lot, like, well before this last weekend, well before the Charlie Kirk shooting, honestly, like for the past year, I'm thinking a lot about, like, like, what fundamentally is going wrong in society? And do you guys care if we just take a second to talk about this? I know it's not finance. I don't have any expertise outside of finance. So take anything I say to a great staff. It struck me maybe a year ago that the people who are trying to find common ground, like, almost entirely, it feels like. And like, obviously in terms of politics more than anything, but lots of other places as well. And I was trying to, like, think backwards through that. And the reason why it struck me, I started getting really, really tired of people saying, I don't want to get political, but we should get political. Like, we just should. We need to, like, get to a point somehow where we can live with each other, where we can trust each other, where we can talk about differences in political beliefs, and be okay with that. And I got so tired of that, and then I started like tracing it back. So just to be, like, totally clear, I like really hate Trump. I can't stand him. If you like Trump, that's totally fine. And I love you. And you're probably right on some things. And I'm probably right on some things, and that's just fine. But as I was tracing this back, it really kind of struck me that, like, this sort of fundamental undermining of trust in society, I don't know exactly where the turnip point was, but it sure feels like somewhere around 2010 is, like, something changed. Where suddenly we had things, like, and, like, I mean, totally fair, to me, it feels more like it started on the left a little bit, and then came along the right where we had things like the Occupy Wall Street movement, and then in response, we had the Tea Party movement. And then we had Black Lives Matter, and then we had, you know, Trump. And everything that came along with that, and this huge anti-immigrant movement now, and, like, this back and forth, where, if you boil it down every single piece of those movements, is trying to undermine trust in some other group. And that is so disappointing to me. It makes me think about, I actually shared this with some MBAs last year, so I'm not sure if I can add that under there. But, like, it makes me think about this. So I want to make five missions before I'm on. And it was so funny to me when I got to Guatemala, and first of all, I did this with Spanish, so I probably went back to the States months, and what I could understand with people were saying to me. They would actually, oh, tell me, like, what are Americans like? And I'm like, that is the weirdest question ever. There's no such thing, right? Like, it's so good, so we're bad. You know, there's all types. I did not know how to answer that question. And then I got home for my mission, and guess what? Everything that comes to me, what are Guatemalan's like? As if you could just put them into a bucket and be like, oh, they're so blank, you know? Humble, nice, kind of. Which they are, but so are Americans, and it was so striking to me how much we wanted to just like put people into their category. And I'm not breaking any new ground here. Like, you guys understand this? That this is like our strong tendency. But it feels like that's gotten like way more extreme in the last 15 years than it used to be. And I don't know how to solve that. But it sure feels like it's time to solve that. It's time to do something. So I have two invitations that I'm going to try to do better at. These are not class assignments. You don't have to do them. I would love to have your report back if you feel like it makes it events in your life. But two invitations. One is this. I've started trying really hard to, well, sorry, let me back up a little bit. When you meet someone or when you're working with someone, you have to make assumptions about who that person is. What they're trying to do. There's no way around that. I know we would love to treat everyone like you're playing sleep. That's not an option. So we say, oh, I don't see race or I don't care about your political party but I don't think that that's actually a really feasible thing to do. So what assumption can we make? Here's my invitation. I'm going to try to do better at this. Start with this assumption. Start by assuming that the other person is doing the very best that they can. Just start with that. And whether that's someone that you learn about on TV or some of you working with in your group or some of your family or whatever. Can we just start with that? Just start by assuming the other person is doing the very best that they can. That doesn't mean they're right. It doesn't mean you have to change your beliefs to match theirs. But it does mean that we can at least give them a little bit of grace to find some sort of calm and calm. There's an invitation number one. In invitation number two is I really think we have a phrase. I think we've, as a society, stopped feeling awe as much as we should. We say awesome way too much. Thank you. And I don't really feel awe enough. It's not even a word we use that often in English. For the non-native speakers, I apologize. Feeling a sense of awe is such an important thing in our lives. So can we all just take a half hour sometimes this week to feel awe? I don't care how you do it other than it can't involve others. That's my phone. Besides that, like get out of nature, go to a concert, go to a sporting event, go for a walk with your group mates, have a good conversation. I don't care what it is, but we need to get a sense of more humility and awe in how amazing things are actually. How great they are, how truly awesome that they are. I actually think that there's a lot of healing that can come from them. So whether that's, you know, you just go clearly to talk about yourself for 30 minutes or you go for walk or whatever. I don't care how you find it, but let's try and do that. And I know, I think especially right now, because I know how busy you guys are and stressed you are about finding jobs and internships and all that stuff. 30 minutes sound like expensive. I think it's worth the investment. I just think it's worth the investment. So those are my two dots. Yes, do whatever you want to do. I don't care. I do care. I don't care if you want to do it. I'm not going to check it on you. That's what I'm talking about. But if you want to shoot me an email, say, hit it in this, it was terrible. That's fine. Hit it in this, it was great. That's all we wanted to talk about. I'll talk to you here about it. Those are my two limitations. That's comments. This is kind of like therapy for me, so I appreciate that. Yeah. No, I just think it's all inside porn. I think it will talk out loud. Everybody said that therapy. I'm just being able to share those thoughts. Yeah, I appreciate you guys willing to listen and how awesome you guys are. Yeah. Yeah. So I live in a state full while and I will back to my home country in China. I don't know. And I don't normally watch them news because I'm not very... I don't want to get political. Get political. Good. But over here, when you see news, you see people portray China as the enemy and all this people live in the trouble there. Love life on the news is common. And when you go to China, when you watch the news, America, everybody is living in trouble. This happening everywhere, this happening everywhere. But as somebody who lives in different places, I would say we just living normal life. It's not like it's like one string to another. Of course, I met trouble people. But I just like less than 0.001% of people that I meet. And the rest of 99% of people are awesome. Like maybe I'm just a literature school, but everybody I go interact with, they come with genuine heart. They want to be friends with you, they want to love you, and then decide that difference is, you know, like we said in my background. And you will see that we wouldn't know that much difference. Yeah. Oh, and I would say it's not that you're in a church bubble. People are just good. In general, people are just really good. There's a few bad apples, of course. In general, like before maybe. Okay. We do have a case to do. Brad, I'm giving you plenty of money. You were so good that I tuned out of like my review. What's going on in this video? Just to start the beginning, WorldCom, they started out as long distance, discount services, long distance, telephone services. Basically, you know, they plan that telecommunications. The market they used to be dominated by AT&T. Over time, a lot of mergers and acquisitions. They've added a lot of capabilities and a lot of size, and they've scaled up. They've made a lot of investments into their infrastructure and yeah, just the services they're offering. So now they're second, only AT&T as far as market share. Well, they will be after this acquisition. So they're working on acquiring MCI. That's going to be a big acquisition. That's what we're raising some money for. And kind of their unique competitive advantage. Let's say they have pretty high-end customer services or someone home now with the wording. Offering end-end, offerings, they offer a wider area of services. From long distance to the Internet and short term stuff and that stuff. So yeah, looking to raise capital, finance, their acquisition of MCI. Issue debt. Okay. Fantastic. Alex, what do you want to add? Yeah, with the debt that they're looking to take on with the issuance of bonds. They are hoping to raise 3 to 4 billion. But they're hoping they go out to 6 billion if there's not interest in the market. Which would lead out the increased factor by a railroad. 4.7 billion by a wide market. So with that in mind, they're obviously looking at the market and see how it's going right now. High dollar, I believe. I heard some just kind of a lot of things throughout the media market. So, I think that's a lot of things that are going to be going on with the market. So, I think that's a lot of things that are going to be going on with the market. Yeah. That's awesome. I was just writing this fast as I can and I captured most of it. You're going to say it? There's a lot of good stuff. Yeah, it's actually. Okay, what else? Is there other stuff that these guys didn't cover? Yeah, down there. There's a heavy calendar debt right now. A lot of competition for corporate bond, and it should go like that. There's lots of bonds being issued. Okay, very good. What else do we have? Yeah, eating. The heat of pay is the heat of 2.6.94 billion. Yes. So, the heat funding. How much do they need to pay? 6.94 billion. So, one of the things that's just... To British Telecommunication PT. Because they own 20% of NCI, and so they're buying all of them. Yeah, and they got to buy them out from PT. Yeah. Ammon, and then set. We're thinking that we're going to get upgraded. Our rating from a VB Plus to A. Yeah. Okay, we're going to put this on the bond issue instead of keep carrying it over here. Hey, Ammon, can you just tell the class a little bit about bond ratings? What does this mean? So, like, the higher the rating, it's just like how likely you are to make the payments. And so, like, the highest, at least in this rating, is like a triple A. And then it goes to like double and single. So, VBB Plus would be upgraded to a NA. That's kind of like the next step. Which means that we can charge all lower group on right, because we're going to be more likely to make the payments. Yeah, exactly. So, think of these bond ratings as proxies, or the probability of default. Firms higher, these companies like S&P and Moody's to rate their bonds. S&P Moody's go through their books, and they try to estimate how risky this bond is, and they'll give it a rating of a triple B Plus, which is... That's called investment grade, but we're headed with a low end of investment grade. When you get below triple B, you end up in like, jump bond status, which is where you get like higher spread. Some people worry a lot more about the bulk. Triple B, you're pretty safe. But single A is even better, double A is even better. Triple A is like, almost risk-free, essentially. Okay. Senate. Oh, in terms of like the telecom industry, their kind of experience, like a growth spurt, because of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. So, it just allowed, basically, when I looked it up, the act kind of just allows for like, different communities, or different companies to compete against each other. So, like customers have more of a choice of like, who they can decide who their provider is. And so, that kind of affects, you know, how they're marketing, or how they're providing services, things like that. Okay, perfect. This is an important part. It's an important part of our landscape, right? We've had this deregulation. It's just a growing industry in general as well, right? Like, not only do we have like long distance, but this is like, the internet's starting to come around. They, uh, okay, there was something in the case about them, like buying something like America online, or something, did the World of Home Own America online for creative time, or did I just misread that? I was like skimming in here yesterday. Anyway, there's a lot of telecom stuff going on around here. So, potential for a lot of growth, and then also the deregulation, like, creates up people in this industry, where typically when you see people, you see lots of having a name, lots of friends putting in part, this happened in the airline industry, it's happening until the telecom industry. Okay, I was, you already got it up, I think, yeah, hiring a lot of companies, and they've been able to have driven track right through the computer, turn those around. So, there's, like, it's not just the growth, but they've been able to create value from that. Yeah. Yeah, excellent. Perfect. James. Nice. We recently agreed to a 12-billion-bank credit facility, so I feel like the bombs are highly delivered to the average trying to get cheaper across the cabin through the bomb. Yeah, let's, let's go to everyone and put this. I'll put it right here. James, does this, we have a big credit facility. Why are we issuing bonds then? Well, the interest we have to pay on that is pretty high on the big credit facility. So, for my, I thought about it, the bombs are like cheaper way to get capital, but we'd like to use the big credit facility to get cash now through the deal, and then the bombs are like the way to pay that off and get cheaper. Yeah, yeah, that's essentially it. So, just a couple things here, just in case people are not aware of the terminology. So a credit facility, that's just a loan. They call it a credit facility because the package together, they actually have two different types of loans. They have one that's a term loan, which is just like a long term loan. And then there's a revolver, which is like a credit card. It's such a business-line credit. When you read stuff like this, and you use a term loan or a C revolver, think of that as being like one that's actually credit card for a, for a World Cup. Oh, and the other is just a regular term loan. So they have this credit facility, which is what they're going to use directly to pay BT and to do this transaction. But the case said they want to pay that out of this quickly as possible using a bond instead. So the bond, if they like, replace the bank credit facility. That makes sense. Now, here's my question to quickly go is, why? So is it? Well, I do a man in it with the, like, the revolver, some of the money, they make a line of the interest payments on that. Yeah. And then what gets your money by making a principal interest, like, it's monthly. Yeah. So the bond, they're, they're going to have to make what's in my hand money. So they're, they're proving their cash flows. I bet that they're increasing on how close they have for those, for that set. And then there are also like a lot of the, most of the bond is not to pay back, so they're mature. So they're even getting similar debt down like 30 years. Yeah. So they're just improving their, their liquidity and their cash flow. Okay, perfect. All really good points. You're exactly right. So with bank loans, typically, they're advertising, the term loans, they are, are advertising. Typically, I assume these are, I don't think the case actually said, but I would assume they are. Which means you have to pay out interest and principal, like every month, or every quarter, or something like that. Whereas with the bond, they're not advertising, meaning you just pay interest. Then you have a big bullet payment at the end. Pros and cons there, right? Like Joseph is saying, hey, this is fantastic. We're kicking that down the road. The con is when your bond comes to you. You've got a huge payment to that point. So you got to figure out a way to refinance that. Yeah. So if you decide like, hey, what's just like to do massive fraud and make a break before that, you have to break it. Yeah. You're the one. I would recommend it. You can go that route. Yeah. Down. So I have a quick question. Does anyone with a footnote that talks about the interest rate for your credit facility? Yeah. And it being tied to the Eurodollar. And then it says, this is $3 a month, the Eurodollar rate was $5.57%. Does that mean, over the last three months, that average annual rate was that much? Or is it saying that, essentially, over a three month period, they'd be paying for the back rate. They're for like an annual rate before that. No, no, that's an annual rate. Okay. Yeah. And actually, this is like the last one of my control lists. I'm not going to dwell on the bank loans right now. I'm not going to do the bonds. It's not the same. I usually bank loans have lower interest rates than bonds. And I guess that's actually the case here, although the case doesn't really state it that clearly. So here's, well, first of all, why do you think bank loans usually have lower interest rates than bonds? Are those because the product is a matter of solid. So they need to make more appeal in their restaurants together. Or if you put the money, which they banked, then just you should borrow the other. That means the more option. Wait, wait, it's a product that who needs to sell? So the bank needs to sell the product. The bank needs to sell the loan. Yeah. So they make the initials that will borrow the appeal into the consumers. Yeah, the companies that need money, the people that need money. Yeah. They just love the bonds or other options that they have in the market. That's why I guess that's stupid. Okay, interesting. So Carlos is basically making the case that like the banking market is just more competitive. And banks have to like work harder to issue the loans. And so that pushes interest rates down. That's essentially it. And what we're saying. Whereas the bond market is being less competitive. That's certainly one option. That's probably not the main option though, I would say. The main reason why. Because the bank will take collateral. So there's more security where the bond is not just. Yeah. So it's really is because bank loans are steeper. It just has to do with risk. So I don't know again that they don't talk a lot of these bank credit facilities in this particular case. A lot of times they're collateralized. But even if they're not collateralized, they're typically senior to bonds. Which means if World Congress goes bankrupt. Which they did. The bank loans get paid out first. And then any value remaining then goes to bond holders. So typically the bank loans have lower interest rates than higher interest rates. They see a hand in the side of the screen. I guess just in doing this. They're increasing their idiosyncratic risk. By making this big part of their. They have like continually invested in their segment of the market. It's all just. They've come. It's not. And they don't. They're diet selling, for issue bonds. They are not mitigating any of that risk. Right. They're. Their overall risk as a company is higher. From. I don't know if we know for sure. Like. It's not like. But by doing the merger. Right. Like World Congress. By doing the merger. And then not. By doing the merger. And going into. So much debt to do the merger. Obviously. Yeah. And yeah. And not backing it with. I don't know any other type of investment. That's. Yeah. That's where they're increasing most of their risk. Okay. Good. Yeah. Let me talk about that briefly. I would say this. The merger itself. It's not obvious to be the best. Increasing or decreasing. They're using credit. If you make an argument that they're diversifying. From World Com to World Com plus NCI. And that actually reduces their increase. They could increase their using credit. Chris give. NCI is like. Just a really risky business that has a lot of it. Use credit. Chris can never. I don't really know the answer to that. The second part is like really important though. Which is you're saying. But they're funny. There's a lot of debt. Isn't that increasing their risk. What do you guys think? Yeah. Now they do have assets to back it up. They have MCI. Right? So they're bringing on more assets. But they are funding it with a lot of debt. That typically does increase risk. And it actually increases both using credit and systematic risk. It just increases their overall risk. It blows up both of them. And we're going to talk more about that on Thursday when we talk about WAC. And the effects of leverage on cost of capital. So it's a really good point. They probably are making themselves more risky by leveraging up this much. That's just typically what happens with firms. The more debt they have, the risk you get they are. And that's the choice. That doesn't mean it does mean it's good or bad. It just means you're risky. Yeah. Can you really explain systematic and idiosyncratic? Yeah, but I can cover it really quick again. Just really quick. Yeah. So there's overall risk. And when I say risk you guys think. There he is. Very good. But we can split that into two pieces. One part I can diversify away. I can invest in a whole bunch of things. And every little idiosyncratic movement. I don't really care about it. Because when one firm goes up, another firm goes down. And those things just kind of come out all of this noise. There's another component that's systematic risk that I really do care about. And when I say systematic risk, I want you guys to think. Not quite as good that time, guys. Covariance. So overall risk is variance. Sistatic risk is covariance. Meaning how does world common miscapes? How do their cash flows? Covariant with the market in general. And if they have a lot of systematic risk, they do really well. But everyone else is doing well. And they do really poorly when everyone else is doing poorly. That's lots of systematic risk. And this is your thing that? That's what beta is measuring. Yes, exactly. Beta is measuring systematic risk. Okay. Yeah, just something that was just like sticking the other one's block. It says that most marvelous servers expected to see the image of a new spawn that offers. So it seems like the market is surprised by this big, all-one offer. Yeah. Which to me feels like we're trying to kick our debt down the road to do a ton of farms right now. Because we don't have the cash drive now to people. Yeah, yeah, excellent. And that, so let's talk about this for just a second. And James, I'll come to you. But why, like broadly speaking, is this a good time for world common deviation news on these bonds? And like why are they doing potentially six billion, where I write that down. So potentially six billion all in one go like Joe, that is pointing out. And like James, I don't know if you want to pull out of that. But I was just going to say kind of to someone else, the reason is one, because they also have a tongue of other like high capital weeks. As a business, so like on top of this, I just have to like, fork out the tongue and cash to do other improvements. Yeah, because that's a good time. Yeah, okay. So good time for bond issues. I wouldn't say good time. Yeah, I'm going to put pros and cons here. One pro is we have to. Right? Hey, we're doing this merger. We're doing all this in the group. We catch. Happy is it's a good time. Regarding smart man, we'll talk about the other market they have. But sometimes you don't really have a lot of choice. And I think that's like actually kind of an important point. Okay? Yeah, James. I mean, it's a con day, obviously don't recommend this yet, but there is the dot combo. That's about to burst. Like if you use your mouth and... We've got helps with double bank currency. And that helps with the bank currency. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm putting a question right here only because they don't know that they're in a bubble at the time. But they certainly work right in the bubble. Now, some people argue that is the best time issue. Because prices are really high and you can get debt really cheap or you can issue stocks and I can get a lot of cash. But if that bubble is about to burst, you might be in trouble. It might not be a good time to lever up a whole bunch, right? Model. So that's a point of recognition of bubble. We're wise on looking at companies' debt ratio essentially and saying, okay, how much money do they have to earn? And you can see that the head of their bubble is... ...looking at the companies that they have. There's a certain momentous, what do you think about this? Yeah. Indicating generally in a whole lot of people who are very willing to take out loans. So there is some recognition that they have in the bubble fast. But I get what you're saying, but I don't know if it's a pro or a con. Where's there a finger is a con? A con. Mostly it's a posterior point of like... There is some recognition that they have of this con in their toys. It's not an unindulging thing. But it sounds like what you're saying, those like lost to their competitors are also taking on a lot of debt. Tell me where that's a con. I think the piece of it is that by them also taking on a lot of debt, they're increasing their system. Right? By some kind of themselves sort of market. And that ain't not only on the company's performance, but the market is okay. Okay. Yeah. There's a lot of risk kind of built up in our particular industry and in the market as a whole. Perfect. So going along with that, the spread is increasing. So the rate that bonds have to be issued out over the risk of pretty rate seems to be increasing. Which means that we're going to have to pay more than we would at the market fund more stable. Yeah, good. So again, just make sure everyone's aware of terms. When you say spread, so then what is the spread? The spread is the cost that investors require. If you like to return that investors require over the risk of pretty rate. So you can have a risk of rate, I can put money in, I know I'm going to get money out. But if I'm going to take out a sector of risk, then I actually need more money than I used to. Yes. Exactly. So this is a term you hear all the time. And it's just my cost of debt above the risk of pretty rate. How much extra am I paying because I'm risky? And so it's exactly right. Spreads are increasing right now. So someone mentioned this earlier that treasury rates are falling. Treasury is falling is that good time or bad time usually she falls. It should be good and such that I like to pick over the juice. They're going to be cheaper than a bulb that's bad to do it now. What's my model there? If the risk of rate is falling, that could be lowering my cost, right? That's this direct impact of this risk rate right here. And that's that treasury is falling could be a great time. And it could just mean people really like debt right now. They like treasury, they like bonds, they're looking to invest, treasury is falling. That could be a probe. But treasury is falling and spreads increasing at the same time. What do you read into the market when you hear those two things at the same time? It's unstable. It's unstable and why are treasury rates falling then? Because there's... Sorry JD, less people are buying. More people are buying that. Yeah, the price is going up and that's pushing the rate down. So everyone wants to buy treasuries. Why would everyone want to buy treasuries? Essentially because the overall risk is increasing. But treasury is the risk free rate. So the overall market risk is not affecting it. So the treasury is going down but market returns are going up. We're going up and that's the overall risk risk. Yeah. Exactly. Go ahead, sir. But this also means that demand is a threat. But we can raise it and sell it. Even though it's higher risk and that people are scared. They're not going to be investing in stock markets. So they can more readily buy our debt than they will stock issue. Yeah, okay. Perfect. So this absolutely can be on both sides. So let me just try to synthesize these points a little bit. Over here on this side, the fact that spreads are increasing and treasuries are falling. What that means is people are flocking to the safe security. They're buying treasuries. And spreads are increasing meaning they're a little bit nervous about corporate default risk. They're charging more for corporate bonds. But what we also know, we also know these two things are going on. You have the Asian financial crisis. You have stocks are falling. You are definitely pulling out of those areas which might mean that investors, their fear is driving them to want to purchase bonds. They're sure safe within stocks. It's actually a good time to issue a bond. Relentage showing stock. Does that make sense? You're going to catch that nuance a little bit. Yeah, we'll come in. It also being interpreted in people hard to see how the media look right or return. And so that would be considered a pro-bid and spread of it is increasing. So you invest in a bond rather than a treasury return is way higher. Yeah, for sure. So this risk return trade-off is always like at the heart and core of everything. The fact that spreads are increasing means, I mean I can see this like multiple ways. One way I can say it is fear is increasing. But I can also say it means people are just demanding higher returns and expecting higher returns. And all those things are true. So we sort of all at the same time. Right. What else? Any other pros and cons for issuing right now? Yeah. In the second quarter of this year they had five times more net income than they did in the past. Ah, yeah. So we have a world-come specific factor here which is like world-come successful. It is the flavor of the month. They are growing, they are acquiring MCI which has captured tons of headlines. They are successful. People are really excited about world-come. So even if the rest of the market is all going crap, maybe people are really excited about world-come. And they are going to be able to respond, real problem. And I think that is important. Yeah, I mean, right. I think probably the time back factor is that they are also like severely over-evaled. And they are in the industry that most of their assets are being added. But 500% pricing is very low. And so it is less likely that they are actually able to pay the overall. And that is interesting. Okay, so sorry, I just want to make sure I understand what you are saying. So you are saying you are looking at the market value of world-come compared to the book value. Is that what you are doing? And you are saying the market value is like how much bigger is five cents? Yeah, that is like 500% percent. Yeah, so if you look at their stock price and multiply that by the number of shares outstanding, that is the market value of world-come. And Nephi is saying let us compare that to what their balance is, which is their book value. And we are going to talk about market value more. But Nephi is saying their way, I want to make everyone say over-value, but they are much more highly valued than all of their competitors. So Nephi's hypothesis is their over-value. That they should, their stock price is too high. What is an alternative? I am not saying you are right or wrong, I don't know. But what is an alternative hypothesis? Yeah, just that people see the most potential for growth here. Exactly. That they are using their assets better than anyone else. And therefore the market price is gone up by a lot. Because they are seeing a lot of potential for that. That is the alternative. I don't know what their answer is. No one understands that. That is why I am not saying so much. I don't know. But it is a super-final way. And if that is true, I would say flavor of the month gives that sense that maybe they are over-value. That is a great time for world-come to issue bonds or stock. It is a terrible time for an investor to be buying them. You don't want to be the investor who buys them because you are probably buying it over-value as prices. Okay, I saw a couple of other things. Good, I see. I am going to say whether for good or bad they are really, there is a lot of over-confidence and then which makes them much more attractive for the one to buy your bond. Yeah. That is probably the good, delicious side of the fence. Exactly. For the king, I said take your perspective of some of the advising world-com and helping them out. From world-com's perspective, this is great. We don't really care if we are over-value or not. We would love to issue bonds right now because the market loves us and they are going to give us really low spreads. Even those spreads in general increasing the rate of hospital spreads because they love world-com right now. Maybe the market is around but that is great. I want to take advantage of that and I love those who are fond of that. I love those who are fond of that. Okay. Any last quick comments on that? Good? Yeah. What happens in the past day? I am so like no track road there when it comes to actually being successful for investors. What there is for shares since they started with wiring in 1996 has not been growing at all since that time. And so a special need to hear what the rest of the industry is doing to be able to draw. So the idea is like oh we are going to be able to meet extra figures for bonds and we have a company that has done that for stock. All these at this point is fuel to kind of shit. Right. Right. Yeah. Exactly. So I mean like in piecing that stuff together is like well look their earnings for shares has been having a meg or eight. They are actual financial performance maybe isn't fantastic. But the market is pricing them really high. Either it says new kinds of taxes and more than that. They are in a bubble and they are more bubbly than most other firms this time. Or that they have this really great investment and we just got to give them a couple of years to get this stuff going in another way in general. I want to catch all of this in that order. I don't know if you are right. This is why people get a big bucks to do this kind of investment. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. The last thing is part of that like 500% value of the nation over their competitors. The best thing that we do to them is that we don't know what we are going to do. It certainly doesn't help. Yeah. Absolutely. I don't know. I honestly don't know a ton about the whole world. I know they are cooking their books by like a few times a week. I don't know if that was actually going on in 1998 or not. So I shouldn't have done that. But if they were then yeah absolutely. That's part of the reason why people are going to be like, oh yeah. Okay. We got to actually price these bonds. So if you have your case just flip to exhibit nine here. Very flat page. By the way, quite a flipping there. The whole point of this conversation. Why I think it's like you'll I always start cases with kind of a broader conversation before we get to the point. I feel like people's tendency a lot of times is to want to make it like oh finance numbers. Let's do it. And I think the process is let's think carefully about like framing this question first. Then let's do numbers in Excel. And then let's go back to our point and see what the numbers are telling us. And I kind of recommend like don't go too fast to just equations. Because we care about a lot of this stuff. And like this is what strategy is all about in terms of like strategy for how to finance your company. So you got to keep it all this stuff. And then see what the numbers are telling you. Do they conform with your worldview or do they reject your worldview? Do they have a change in your country? So that's kind of why I do it. Okay, in Zim and 9 we've got a bunch of information here. But we don't have yields. How do we how do we get to yields here? And don't just tell me you use the yield function. I didn't already use. But how do we get to yields? Like what's the idea here for me to do that? How do I how do I get to be yield? Yeah, me if I could use the present value function. So by doing the first period plus how many piers that you have, you give out your amount of your giving picture on the base value. And then over the one plus your good amount, you use the exponent how many piers is this. Exactly. We're just going to use a present value formula. And it turns out the wonderful thing you had to exhibit at 9 is the last column is present values. That's what that price is. It is a present value. And so what we want to do is we want to get a sense of what WorldCom's bond is going to price at. And we're going to use comparable bonds to get at that price. And like mostly what we're going to do is we're going to talk about what makes a good comparable bond for the next 20 minutes and then it's done. But real quick before we get there, let's just make sure everyone's like definitely on the same page. So what's the best comparable firm to WorldCom? What's the most comparable firm? WorldCom, right? They're the most comparable firm. So what do we take WorldCom's 8-year bond? And I'm just going to like map this out really briefly. Just to make sure everyone's like really good at this going on. So I've got WorldCom's got 8-year bond. I'm going to start with the border and then I'll move to itself. What's the information I want to know? I want to know the yield to maturity. What is the yield on that bond? Because that's what's going to help me inform if WorldCom issues new bonds right now, what's their yield code? What is their cost of capital going to be? So I need to find the yield to maturity. So to do that, I've got a present value here of 1077. And that has to equal the sum of future cash flows, right? So we've got some cash flow plus R raises to T. And that R, which I wrote really terribly, that's the thing that we want to know. That's all we're doing is we're using this formula to figure out what we are. Now in this case, these bonds pay semi-annually. And they have a coupon rate of 7.75%. So what do these cash flows look like? Is it going to be a certain amount? Exactly. Which is the coupon rate with hubs. Is that the coupon rate of 7.75? Yes. So it's 777 and 50 cents over 1 plus, or sorry, you're actually going to say it equal to the present value. Yeah, but you're exactly right. So you're 1, we're going to get 775. Right? You're 2, 775. 775, and I'm not going to write out that whole thing, but I get out to your 8. You get 1,777. 1,775. And I'm just going to put all that into an equation, set it equal to 1 to 770, and then solve for the R. So everyone understands that's what excels in doing what you use at yield function. Any questions about that? Yeah. Since it's semi-annual, would it not be better to do that 38.75 over 1 to 16 here or even in front? Yeah. Absolutely. And that's what I've selected before. So I'm going to write it a simple way here, just so I know what's going on. But you're exactly right. I'm going to make that one more time. Let me try my mouse here. I'm going to make that one more time. I'm just going to show you your head. Really, what's happening is 0.5 years, 1.5 years, 2 years, and I'm basically mapping this out. So I'm going to do this the long-hand way for a second. We'll use the yield function, but I just want to show you the long-hand way. This is basically what's happening. I've got the current price. I've got my coupon rate. And these are the actual cash flows. At six months from now, I would get 3.27. If I'm doing this in hundreds, rather than thousands, just to make it hard. I get that every year, and then as I keep going, if I get all the way over here at the end, then you see I get the 3.27. And if I plus my principal return. These are my cash flows all the way across here. If I buy this bond. And here I'm using the IRR function. You guys ever seen the IRR function? It's the internal rate return. Basically, the IRR function says, give me a stream of cash flows, where the first one is negative, and the rest are all positive. And I'll tell you the discount rate that solves that formula so that it comes out equal to 0. So the negative equals all the positive. Does that make sense? We also use the IRR function. Yes. Yeah. You can use IRR, you can use rate, you can use yields. Oh, hey. They all do the same thing. So it's going to give me a rate of 3.25%, but that's a semi-annual rate. So I just multiply that by 2 to get 6.5%. And that's my yield, I'm not sure if you're good. Questions about mechanics? That's awesome. I'm going to stay with you. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's all right. Go ahead. So I understand the pain semi-annually, but you can just calculate it annually. And get the same thing. It comes out to be only a second. Oh, yeah. It's happening. I just want to show like, literally, this is exactly the type of effect. It's semi-annual. This is the kind of effect. Now, of course, I'm not going to go through this process. Or every single one. I'm just going to use the yield functions. So here, I'm just using the yield function. And I've just put in all the fields that I need. I like the yield function in this particular instance. You can use the rate function. You can use IRR if you want. I like the yield function because I have the settlement date and the redemption date. And then the yield function kind of works with those really easily. So that's why I used it, but I don't really care. And I get all these different yields to ensure E. And again, just for some terminology sake here. Notice I have here spread to treasury. And then I'm listing these in basis points. A basis point is always A 100th of a percentage point. So 64 basis points is 0.6497 percentage points. Just for fun. All right. So I can go through that process. Like once I figure out the yield function, figuring out all of those yields isn't very hard. Now we have 15 minutes. We have to figure out what are, what makes a good comparable firm to WorldCom? Or how did you guys come to estimates? Let's see, what is the case one? I wanted a three year, seven year, three year, five year, seven year, thirty year. Like what process do you guys go through here? Like, come to estimates. And like what a good yield would be. Yes. We looked at the yielding and you know, it was similar in the yielding and sign print. Three years in treasury. And then we can get the exact use as our accomplishes. Perfect. Okay. So, what makes a good Alic is saying, Alic, Alic is saying, Moody's reading. But then you mentioned something else at the end. You said, maturities. How does that be used to maturity? Yeah. Tell me, first of all, why, why does the Moody's reading matter? Why should that be an important component in picking your account? Because it's a lower rating than they're about to have a higher return in the form of speed. And then, so, it needs a similar bond and a similar rating. It's going to have to be a similar pool. So, it's going to have to be a standard market pool. It's going to be a sort of just good. Yeah. Exactly. So, let's like, back up just a second. What makes a good account? What do we need the good account to have? Similar risk. Similar risk. What kind of risk? It is an credit for systematic. Systematic. That's the key. We need similar systematic risk. And we need it over a similar timeframe. Because that's what discount rates do. So, that's why you're like, drill this in you over and over and over. Because, really, that's all there is to it. That's all we're doing. Because we're just trying to find what are some other bonds that are treating you. And then, right now, that are over a similar timeframe with similar systematic risk. Because that's what it is now. And, Alex says, well, the mood is rating should give us a good starting point here, because it is literally a measure of risk. Right? I would agree with that. I know that's a lot of sense. And then, he also says, we want over a similar year, with similar use of maturity, to make a similar timeframe portion. That makes sense. What else? Are there any other factors we might consider? I think, I mean, essentially, we're only for a counter-backward, right? So, a company that would be the same world on absits, the other blockers would be similar. They're a little bit rude, so, we'll be like, T2P, or if we add a first telecom as a measure of companies that were trying to be the same thing in England. Uh-huh. Just, it is simply right, inviting that what would work out would play absits in these two countries. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, we're definitely looking for a counter-factual, and we're trying to find what is another firm that's like us. You pointed to GTEs. GTEs are they a good comp for WorldCon? Alice, you feel enthusiastic about it. What makes GTE a good comp for WorldCon? Uh-huh. They have a similar rating in that day, or in A and A. We've got them right here, for example. Yeah. Yeah, they're single A rated. They also, I mean, they're finishing the ventures, which we have in Google. Those are sometimes too, like, getting half of the direct ones. A lot of them, there's an A lot of them, which is usually said, like, in English, that's a lot of them, in the stitchings. Yeah. So, we built that mash-up, and then also the time frames. They had it to the third year, seven year, five year, three years. Yeah. Exactly. So, lots of stuff, lots of things going for GTEs. Similar rating, maybe a little higher, but it depends on how you read in this whole, like, where's currently rated triple B plus, but we might get upgraded type of a thing. And there's the bond market in that. Because the bond market, you're going to price this, like, a triple B plus. Or they're going to price this, like, a single A rated bond. I don't know. But they're still, like, rated, and they got all the rate of maturity. So, we can map out, it's called a yield curve, which is just, like, yields over time. We can map that out for A. What do they have? They have a three year, they have a five year, they have a seven, they have a 30. So, lots of stuff going for GTEs. So, what do you guys think about, should we just take GTE, just them, and use them as our comp, and, like, we're done. Let's try. I set up that Christian to sound like, definitely not. And I don't mean it, but it's not an unreasonable way to go, but they're pros and cons of it. Yeah. The GTE is great, and the movie rating is more. So, risk will be, the set of worst books will be about the same. We also depend on which yield will be shorter, to the worst year's measure, which is maybe two to the bigger. Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Perfect. Zach, what our group did is, we've had it took for each year of bond. As you understand, we took two companies that were, one was rated higher, and one was rated lower. And we figured that we would be somewhere in the middle, because we're in the yellow value. Yeah. So, we did GTE plus, like, 360 one time, like, news America, you know, so with it. Yeah. Perfect. So, 360 is an interesting example here, right? They are, really similarly rated, like they are basically our same rating here. So, that's great. The only downside of 360 is we only have one observation. So, we can't map out a hole, yield curve for them. So, there might be a great comp for the seven-year, right? So, I ended up not using 360, but it's not because, like, it might always be the right way or the wrong way. Like, that makes perfect sense. Like, we're in free-street level, we're going to find the most comparable, on taking average of those. Something like that. I sure think we can find these. Yeah. Another step we also took after giving us, like, comparison to GTE, is that, accounting for the difference in the S&P rating, with the ZF8, where we can see that is actually 430-year bond. A rating would have a 93 points for it, but a triple-view plus or a real one of the seven. That's an extra 14 basis points, so that we could just add that on to the inventory. Right. For our major issue. Yeah, exactly. So, that's a different way to go. So, like, just to clarify, in case people in Paul Adams do it, one option is, you take exhibit eight, which shows the spreads, and you can adjust them. So, if we have, say, GTE, is single A-way, but we think we're going to be triple B plus. Well, if you look at exhibit eight, you can see, single A relative to triple B plus is an additional 14 basis points. So, you take GTE's yield maturity here, and add 14 basis points. You get a good estimate of what we would issue our one. Something like that. Perfectly the reason we could. And all of these make sense to me. Yeah. The question, S and P and Moody, are those both measurements of this manifest risk? Is it different scale? Yeah. The different scales. Two, and there's also a third company called Fitch, and there's a few other tiny ones with, like, basically, S and B Moody and Fitch and two big ones. They have slight differences in exactly what they measure. And I forget what's shown is which one is, like, purely the probability default. And the other one is, like, probability default multiplied by a lost given default. Like, if you do default, how much are you going to lose? But they turn out to be almost always in my set. So, the thing of that is, like, basically, two, and three. Okay. Stuart. So, we've checked in, it's a six, where it lists the five, very first, like, basically, we've got a jerky, four, or each of those, and we've checked it. And there's something with these eight, 12, 12, 12, from these two points. Yep. To compare to those companies, like, we, and we noticed, it's all higher. It's not just the kind of demand for spawns. It's a combination of two things. So, yet, one is the demand for spawns. The second thing is, and this is, like, really the last point I want to make, and then we'll just wrap up the case. So, this is perfect, actually. The second thing is, besides the ball rating and the maturity, lots of times people point to one third thing that they will get. Is that mean guesses? Industry, exactly. Are you in the same industry? Why should industry matter so much? And I promised I'm going to answer your question. Jeff. The co-bearance. Because like you talked about, you do something like a utility company. They're co-bearance, maybe much lower. Are there any customers? Exactly. Our industry is just another proxy for systematic risk. It's just the co-bearance, right? And telecom companies have, in general, a fair amount of systematic risk. And so we probably want to use other telecom companies as our comparable firms. Now ideally, the ball rating is going to basically account for that. But ball ratings are still somewhat coarse, right? Like not all triple B plus firms are the same. So if I can find triple B plus firms that are also in telecom, that's even better. Not just like sort of blindly because they're in the same industry. But because firms in the same industry tend to have similar systematic risk. Does that make sense? So, and like Stuart, this is the other answer to your question. The other question is, these all price a little bit higher than you might expect. Because they're all in telecom. Telecom tends to have a little bit more systematic risk. So they're still in that triple B plus bucket. But they're slightly on the risk of your side. Or the single A, the shock hit. Slightly on the risk of your side. Because they're just a little bit more exposed to systematic fluctuations. Then the average single A firm, or the average triple B plus firm, is the end of that industry confidence. Does that have any things that I just get? Yeah. So those are kind of the key components that we're going to look for. And like you guys have already pointed out, there's actually a lot of ways to do this. Also, one way to do it, you're going to get very similar answers no matter how you do it. I chose News America World Common GTE as my three best comps. Basically, going for similar ratings. Oh wait, GTE is single A, wasn't it? It's a B, the way it works. Oh, B, it's just B, the way it works. Oh, B, it's just B, the way it works. So I wanted to make sure I got World Cup in there because I feel like World Cup is my best comp for World Cup. Even though the maturity is not that exactly. So I had to kind of interpolate these yields a little bit from the maturities that I do have. So you can see I've got this really nasty looking bunch in here. All I'm doing is I'm taking maturities on either side of the three year and interpolating with just a linear mind. Kind of roughly what that yield would be in the middle there. And that's just because I wanted to use World Cup since they are the best comp for World Cup. And then of course I have these other ones just to like, as a gut check, am I in the range? And I can't. Why wouldn't I interpolate actually 30 years for World Cup? It's just so far out. Like I don't really want to draw a line out that far. I'm rather kind of trying to base it off with these two instead. So this gives me a pretty good sense of roughly where these yields are going to land. These are relatively close to numbers you guys found I would assume. Yeah. So, last question for me and then I'll wrap up and I'll say what happened to misguise. Here's the last question for me. So you are consulting for World Cup or you don't know for World Cup. Come to this, roughly this is kind of where we think we're going to land. These are pretty tight ranges of estimates. We have a pretty good sense. We issue a high view bond. We're kind of right around that 6.35 percentage. One of their options is do we have the size issuing of bond? And issue more of the stock. We get issue stock. How do we feel about issuing stock right now relative to issuing bonds? I would say stock is not as good because we're expecting our evaluation to go up which is more expensive in the long term. Uh-huh. Yeah good. So if we think our stock price is going to rise, you don't want to issue right now. You'd rather wait for it to rise and then issue when that stock price is higher because you get more cash. And the equity market is just not good. And the equity market is really right. If people are nervous, it's usually better to get less risky rather than more risky. So if people are nervous, everyone's thinking stock market, you want to go or the investors are, which is more in safer securities like bonds. Okay, so that would be one option. Yeah. Check when I'm trying to be back. People are marketing nervous. Yes. Where is our horizon? Why are you talking about that? Uh-uh. Well, because Brazil is rising. That's how we know it. We don't actually know any other way. I mean, you'll read commentary and people will say stuff, but people say stuff that's quite wrong. All of a sudden, I think. Blueberry and water and all of that. People always want to tell stories. And often those stories are true, and often they're not true. So I always trust the numbers more than the stories. But the numbers show spreads are whiting. That just means people are charging more for the risk that isn't more. They must be angry. And that case, we don't think this case will be further rising because we're going to be at 8. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so one option, if we can issue stock, what's another option? We'll just stick with the loan that we already have. Yeah, exactly. We can stick with the loan that we already have, which most likely are saying earlier, most likely have slightly lower interest rates than this. The downside of loans is banks like to have lots of oversight overdose. My guess is that's really why WorldCom doesn't want to see this alone. Because banks put a lot of covenants on their loans. They're going to be taking me through all the time. They want to be buddies, except not really buddies. They want to be buddies with a reasonable amount. But that is another option. We can look at this and be like, I don't know. I don't know if the bank loan is priced at, but maybe it's 5.8%. I would actually take that lower interest rate to share a good one with you this. And that's certainly another option and not a crazy option, especially given the term WorldCom. Let me tell you what happened. They issued the bond. Here's where they priced that. The 3-year is 6.125%. The 5-year is 6.25%. The 7-year is 6.4%, and the 3-year is 6.95%. Pretty close to what I have here, but what was true about all those? On the lower end. What does that tell you? High demand or low demand? High demand. Everyone in those bonds, which pushed the yields lower. Everyone in them prices were high, yields were lower. They issued $6.1 billion. They didn't. They just went for the whole domain. They went out. They had a lot of demand. And so they did it. That was the large corporate bond issuance ever to that point. You guys know what guesses? Who has issued the large corporate bond issuance ever today? It's another telecom company. Verizon. Verizon. Who purchased all the assets of WorldCom after WorldCom. Verizon. Verizon is exactly as low. Verizon issued a $49 billion. No. Yeah. That's the company. So anyway, yeah. They had a lot of demand. Yeah. What are the points already? A lot of just practicing people's bonds. Practicing thinking about what? Why does the bond price have to do with this? What is systematic risk? What are the contracts going to be? And the internet? It's a lot of stuff. We got it. Thanks all, guys. I'm Peter."
