She got to work on a stage? Or is she, she probably would be right next to you. She wouldn't have. What'd you do about that one? You should have a whiteÊµÅlet of water there. Like small, though, sinking, soccer volleyball, that could do. And likebble cherry and thenit chips. They like Mr. Brown could do white collar and they went can't be with their dad on the couch ever. Wow, who's got a kid? He's a kid. Steward. What happened? My daughter likes eating the brown ginseng. That's a pretty good boy. Wow. Oh, we don't even know. Yeah, that's okay. He's not my dad, huh? He looks at it. He doesn't understand. He's on the phone. Steward, do you ever think I do? You can pull this up for a while. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, I love this. So, we're really about re-freaming your career, designing your career. I feel like there's a lot of different things that are focused where we want to be great at everything. And I love these different structures that show us that you need to do many good things. The road and free will, the power is in us. If we can always be down in the good works, that every night, the guy is burning and that doesn't be nice and short because that's okay. I think the Lord encourages us to do a lot. And frankly, for me, that can be exhausted. I remember very distinctly on my mission in French Paul Giaf, at one zone conference, we have completed the hours in the data we had and the expectations from both our mission president and the handbook. And realize the map and the athlete actually didn't work out for us to do everything that we were doing after the deal. And then they're telling me, like, how is it going to be in it? We're like, it actually, it's basically in the hours of our day, it doesn't work. At least it didn't work for me as a trainer at that point to do all of the things you have to make decisions. And fortunately for me, before that point, I had had a trainer who my mission had been like, pretty hard for me at that point. He was from New Caledonia and he was just us two, speaking French on the kind of farthest side of the island from everyone else. And he told me to make a goal. And so we were making our goals together. And then he said, no, no, I want you to make like a crazy, unreasonable goal. You need to get outside of your mind. And so my goal that I made was to catch a shark with my bare hands. And he'd like, that's more like it. My goal is going to be to ride in the ambulance, hopefully not with you, because of the shark's goal. But frankly enough, we both completed our goal. I went to the island of Tucker-Roe, where we just picked like fish, track, thing, and walking along, I was able to grab this sleeping nurse shark and hold it up and be like, I caught a shark with my bare hands. And he got to ride in the ambulance, not with his injury, but because he had a word mission here who was an ambulance driver. And so it's been places in the ambulance. So that was the vehicle he had. And I think it's cool when you get outside of yourself, outside of all the things that you have to do right now, and you realize that you can pull to accomplish more, but you can also let some of those things that you think are super important to go. I found that one of my strengths on a mission was community with children. So I played a lot of marbles. I would say one of my proudest moments was when after playing marbles with all these random kids in the street, this parent came out and was like, are you playing marbles? And I was like, yeah, you want to join us? And he was like, I guess I do. And then the next day we walked fast and we saw this dad playing marbles with his kids in the street. And we were like, yes, like that's what you should be doing. And so when you think outside of those frameworks and you're able to, I guess, prioritize the things that really matter to you, that are your strengths, you're able to view more effective. So people change this line. And I really like this scripture because I think it gives us more of a focus where it holds so many different things to do. And we can do it. But I love this scripture that reads, ye blessed their day whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel for they shall receive for their reward, the good things of year, and it shall bring forth an end strength, and they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, day and with commandments, not a few, and with revelations in their time, they that are faithful and do the temple for me. And then I love this because it talks about being crowned with blessings. And I know that if we focus on the things that are most important, the rest comes. In Tahiti they have the tradition of, in French they would say, Puro-ne, but to crown someone with a laze. And that has always changed my perspective of this scripture, that it isn't that you're like, you're king now, you're in charge. But when you're crowned with laze in Polynesia, it's a very personal intimate experience where you leave an area for this new island, the Pukero, and all the people that you need a difference in their life come up to you. And they thank you by putting this leg on you. And they say, thank you very, very grateful for that. And there's a lot of a week in that. Actually, I wasn't able to put my legs in my bag on my right home because it made my bag over a week. And so I had like 50 pounds of these legs as I was flying home on my neck, at least through the security and night control rush. I'm really curious. But that, not the image to me is something that I strive for to feel like I'm making a difference. Because I know that it's a little bit, that we're crowned with borders. And it comes from both singles that big of a story and the differences that you see in those pieces. So I'll see that in just a second. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All of a sudden. Good luck with it. Whatever you're doing, something you may be saying here, something you may be going on, a national black, something you may be going on. I'm going to face the truth. So you see, learn what I'm saying. We'll see you back on Tuesday. The only thing unique on Tuesday, we are going to be talking about personality testing, which is often an important part of the hiring process of a lot of companies. I'm going to have you take two of the most important personality tests that are used in the board of systems, which is by the NETI. And you will put your results into the culture swing. We can look at the aggregate of where our class falls. We can compare you to the morning sections. Sometimes there's differences. I'll compare you to my NISM students that I'm keeping right now. So you can see, sometimes there's selection effects in different programs. But we'll get some of those differences. Your client contact and research question will also be on a date. So all we're looking for there is, this is one out of 100 points. So this is not going to be super punitive if you're in an organization yet. We just want to know, name of organization, name of your main client contact, and then the general description of the type of project you're using. The next step after this one will be more detailed engagement letter. But this is a really simple deliverable question. Questions about that? Four of the research questions is that something that's like, what do you sign up for? Do we ask them of the big ones? So I would collaborate with them and say, you know, we're MBA students. Here's some of the step we're learning about. Here's some of the HR processes you're learning about on board. We're learning about selection. We're learning about forest management. We're learning about terminating. I'm not a classic, we're a class pilot. That one's really... I'm not a trivia teacher. I mean, this letter is not a letter, it's not a scientific. They might say, great, you're not a part of the whole thing. I'm not a... That's a... Yeah, we're working on a flyover. You can go on. What HR processes, like you're doing, really take the lead diagram with the inter-procation. Okay, the other thing, and I hate to read this letter, it just stokes things I hate. You guys already sound like you're doing that. So our midterm is going to be our cover 16. Because of the way classes are going with midterms around that time, they said I can do both sections at the same time. So we're going to have the exam at 8 a.m. on our cover 16th. The case, and the midterm is called barbed wire morocely, and it's going to be a big change in the middle, so you're going to do it. And there'll be probably around 10 questions. Every question says, teach Barbara this concept or this framework, and kind of teach her how she could apply it in this particular context. Sometimes there's not enough context. And so I might say, imagine this about Barbara, or imagine this about Barbara's team. Teach Barbara about this concept and what does she actually apply to? So the level of understanding required to teach something back is pretty intense. That's what makes it hard. It's not a rocket science. You're not going to come out of this and be like, we never were talking about that in class. But what's going to happen is, you're going to have all these demands. You're going to have limited time. And so sometimes we will put it into time. It's really going to set. Then we're going to ask the teacher back. The test just reveals that you don't know your stuff. That's why it can be a little bit harsh. So averages tend to be in the 70s. Sometimes worse. We just curve it. So I don't want to stress out. I don't think I'm going to be able to explain it. I'm going to say it's a very good finance. So I may have a lot of time on it. But you know what the midterm is all about. So you have that case in your case packet. So you don't have to read it tonight. But there's weeks. So I can talk about this more in the midterm recession. But you know what the concept is. And you can start applying some things we're talking about to this case. And that's why I always. And the task itself is verbal. You're going to be writing on your computer for 75 minutes straight. So you can sit there. You can like studying your mind. But the test is going to have to be put in the words on paper. So don't miss that step in your studies. You can talk to the people in your groups and teams. You talk to spouses. Or you talk to roommates. Or whoever it might be that you can kind of teach out loud. Or you go get a whiteboard and a study room and whiteboard stuff. But sometimes people might think it's a study in their heads. And then they get to that part where they have to actually express it. And I'm going to say that as you guys have it felt in my head. Chat you be T computer resource. I have students that will be. And I'll give you slides and chat to the teams. They ask me questions. I'll chat to the team. I ask you questions in the slides. Well, they'll be like study guide and also compiled slides. Yeah. So I will do like a midterm reviewed deck. It's mostly just the summary deck you already have access to. And I put it in one place. So I would wait until you get that to serve. Not to miss. I've got time. We have review sessions. So reminding when you guys were proposing. Was it Thursday evening or Monday evening? Yeah. So it's like, sorry, not this Thursday or Monday. Before the exam. Yeah, the week before. Would you prefer like a Thursday evening, like 5 or 6 p.m. Which is like about a week before, so October 9th. Or the Monday evening, a few days before. A few days before. There's no vote probably, right? So like who votes Thursday? I don't know. I don't want to write. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's my one-up for? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hopefully you're not using your stuff. I think it's really what we say more than we were like, oh, I don't think so. And then what happens if you're a company? No, we ask questions. And then we will expect a series. Oh, and I'll probably ask this to the head of the tech. I'll just say it. I'll just say it. And then I'll think one on Tuesday. If he's on a Thursday. Tuesday during class. No, this would probably be outside of classical. Do you guys have stuff at 330? I don't know. I did it from like 330 to 5. That would work. That's part of that Tuesday, 330. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. That's all right. Okay. And this is just kind of cool. This is just something that I do. But there's actual research that shows dating pictures. No. In both positive emotions, even if you're not sure. And so after I talk about the truth. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. Okay. There's my daughter, Claire, who was a little bit of a video. She has been getting into stuff since she was very young. And that has not changed. The password today is Neptune. It was a good 1446 Neptune was discovered on this day. So I'm going to put it over here. The furthest credit was to include it. But then they decided that your relegated. It's like your British primarily soccer either. You don't have to put it back. It's a perfect name. All lower days. Successful tall lower days. Okay. Last time you talked about your job, character, six model. It's a good spot. It's like having Dale here. Was that helpful? Yeah. Okay. You know, we love having guest speakers in. We always want them to be super useful. Sometimes you hope students will be wishing that that was their instructor. You know. But we talked about the job here. It's a small and how to calculate an NPS for today. We're going to focus on work for your perspective. And this lecture has been worn out of a lot of office conversations and I think it's been worn out of a lot of office conversations. I have a student. This is paralyzed by some of the decisions that are trying to make. And so this is to me a synthesis of some of the cultural messages that shape your expectations about your own work. And I think are really overly simplistic and cause challenges for you. And then we're going to talk about some really simple principles of job. I hope you can help eliminate some of the stress that you can do. I hope you leave today with a little bit more confidence, a little bit more calmness in relation to your career and your job surface. I think that's really stressful right now. So why care about this topic? Work is a really critical life-giving for a good chunk of our lives. If you more spend more time at work than you really are, you're going to have more than you spend with your family. It's just a way life is structured. And people who is an organizational scholar, suggested that the average person spends more than 90,000 hours at work in their life, which equates to one third of your entire life situation. So of course it would be nice if that time was spent getting something to do actually. So as you think about cultural messages about forcing, what are some of the dominant cultural messages that you hear that you're exposed to about what your work life will be like for most people? What is work life for most people? Drudgery and be really boring. Boring, right? It's just labor, right? You're putting in your time, your pain in your news. These are all cultural phrases that communicate that idea that work for most people is just art. It's not really enjoyable work, it's sex. I like this job marginally more than I like being homeless. I was slowly crushing my soul. The CEO is happy, this sure looks like a pyramid scheme. And they've just one hour from now, I'll have four hours left until I have to work in here three hours. I think that's how work is portrayed in the media. These are some of our most popular television shows. How is work portrayed here? It's a way, right? It's boring, it's just ineffective. It's just something you do, buy your time to tell you to go on a journey. I don't need to kind of, oh, but I just present. I present, obviously, a very serious situation. Some people actually find themselves in it, so again, I don't need to be in sensitive. But this is just kind of a mean that I'm here as present and work. In most cases, it's the kind of reason why I hate being in it. Work is worse than prison, right? I recognize that work is not worse than prison. This is kind of the first message that we see is that the most work is going to be miserable. It's going to be really hard. It's going to be tedious. This is a man named Nigel Marsh. He says, there's thousands and thousands of people being quiet lives of desperation where they work long hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. Is that for a optimistic view of the future, right? Yeah. So, cultural message one is, remote, most work is going to be miserable, or hard, difficult. What does the world suggest your life should be like? Passion, right? What else? Say it, surfing, right? What else? I really thought 100 in a long way. I thought you were all about being able to do what you want. Express myself by deep, meaningful work. These are some of the messages we're going to present. I'll just make it kind of like, what do we do with that? What's the way that we do that? How do we get to that type of a situation? Well, you've got to find your calling. You've got to find your calling in line. This is Jeff Bezos. You can have a job, or you can have a career, or you can have a call. If you can somehow figure out what I have a calling, you hit the jackpot. That implies this is some random thing that you're going to look into. If you find your calling, you're going to have this amazing life. But most of you are sorry, you're not going to get into jackpot. This jackpot is only for people. What do you think about this idea of calling? What do you mean by that? This is Amy Rissi. She's a board of professors. graduate from the University of Michigan. She says, he can fully work with you. That would be the visual release makes the world better place. There's nothing wrong with striving for that. That's what it is. We always have. This idea that you've got to go find that. You can find it. That's your ticket to winning the jackpot. Now, I had you watch this video. I don't always show you resources, because I think this is like perfectly representative. My perspective on how I feel. What did you guys take out of this? Helpful things that you maybe push back on as you're watching this? I didn't love it. I'm not going to show a lot. There was something about it. It felt a little great and scary, maybe. But also, maybe not. Great or scary, actually. I feel like it was all really simplistic and just kind of like nothing matters as long as you find your path. I don't know. I found it not very applicable or helpful in my current situation where I'm actually grappling with this attack question. So I don't know if I ever thought about that. But I didn't love it. I don't think you're going to be dealing with it. No, I agree. I mean, one of the video format that we've felt, comedy and hard music, oh, it's not in the part of the room, it's great and not having to reach this audience. It's between my and my past jokes. But there's also this piece of like any kind of very close. It's really what we use when we're successful about it. Oh yeah, the patch that I have a bunch of different things. And I always like, whatever you like do a patch and about it, you just commit to it and it will be well off. And that's not always true, right? Like, we have survivors by this here in this aspect of it. It's the people for whom it does work out that get to talk about this. And not the people who really will do the patch and about something. And then they fell off their face and now we're working in whatever craft out there what happens to it. That's part of it. Other stuff. Anyway, I'm sort of agree with Monty because yeah, even like the Jeff Fizzle, this quote that we just saw, it's like, oh, see, you're calling. It was to be like 100 billionaires. That's really lucky. I wish that was my calling. I would've just always had one too. Whereas like, maybe inside you're calling is to be like an elementary school teacher and make like barely enough good with. And then, yeah, that disparity is just, it's calling. Like that elementary school teacher found their passion. Yeah. I know for me it's hard because like, boy really your passion is, right? I was, I remember when I was in the cat and boy, the CEO was saying that when he got hired by the company, he didn't like his job. But he like, more he'd do it the more he liked it. He got better at it, not having to see you up. No, the boy was the very big company, right? So like, for me it's really hard to decide, like, like, really have pattern towards this, I can go forward or do I just like, oh, it doesn't matter, I like it or not, I'm just going to stick with it and just be better at it. And just kind of devolve passion because I got better at it. You know, this is hard to decide. I think there's this thought about like, you live to work or you work to live, right? Like I think there's, you can find passion and I think it's important to like your job and to want to do better and like like it enough. But, and then I get to spend a third of your life there. But the rest of your life, you got to make meaningful too, right? So, I think you find the work like balance of, yeah, I'm not super passionate about it, but I find passion in other ways outside of my job. I'm going to say, I, I'm, I subscribe a big time to, like, just saying like, I hate the concept that we just trade our time for money. Look, I think the problem that people, it's easy to forget, none of us forget it because it's happening all this because like, why it still happens, while you're working? It's like, there's not a good world just stops and like, we forgot to get our work today, so we can like deal with our graph. It's like things happen and so, if all I'm doing is just trade, I think that's where people work down, right? It's like, gosh, I got everything coming on the outside of work, but I got to be here to punch the clock to get my paycheck. I don't want that, it's only more stuff coming on the outside of work than I need to, you know. So, I think it's finding, if you have a passion around it, that you can find a passion in it, you have to, like, well, exactly what you do, so if you can build a passion in doing it, which I guess is kind of this job, creating things, right? Then, then with like the stuff comes, it's still a little easier, and you can find that balance of like, hey, I actually can't work today, but I got a million bucks for the outer of whatever it is. Trigger the last work here. Oh, yeah, part of the video goes, I watched it a few days ago, and the last night I was looking for you for today. I didn't remember watching it, so I just restarted it, and even now I don't remember anything else. So, I guess this thing, like, what was it, like, well, clearly nothing in there felt useful enough to help grow? That's funny. That's funny. So, I'm sorry. You guys, you think you're a little bit useful? It's a concept of 8020, and I don't subscribe to 8020, but just that idea that there is a sense that you should probably enjoy more about your job than you hate, right? And in different jobs, that's going to be different, but I think that's an important move of them. And then the other thing is that, you know, it's experimental. We always think career paths are really linear, and we get freaked out, or not. But most career paths are not linear. And many of you are a testament to that right now, because you've been in a career path and you decided, I want to use the MBA to pivot to something else, because that wasn't what I was hoping for, that wasn't what I was expecting. And so, I think those two principles, I think, are helpful. So, in contrast to that, I had to read Jeff Thompson's article. And Jeff Thompson is the director of the Soren Center at the whole leadership here at the Biden Group. That's how it's here, but it's here anyway. His academic appointment is in the Brownie Institute during the Business School. And Jeff is just an amazing mentor, some of that has been a really important part of my career. And I love these cultural messages that he's describing that I keep aligning with what we're talking about. These things that you hear all the time about calling. But, you know, it's a matter of luck. You don't fight it. You're never going to be truly fulfilled. But when you do, you're going to face a blissful existence and people will take notice. And that really work is how you can fill this idea of calling. And I just love how he provides a gospel perspective on this. That you don't have calling. We're not talking about calling the church, right? Those kind of things. We're talking about in this life, you've been fordained, you've been said here, to do really important good works to your fellow minimum. And you bring all kinds of spiritual gifts that you build, that you build about, to the different positions that the one plus is you have. And, you know, when you work to impress or option, others do violate the one's vision of work. Work is simply one stage of commitment you can have about our service to the other fellow. Any other reactions thoughts about this article? It's really easy to be, in my mind, cynical about the, like, only follow your passions. And it's also easy to, like, overly follow the love. But at the end, they're like, I can't do any work that's like, that I just don't love all the way. And so what I loved about this article is I felt like it found, like, the middle path, and it actually got to the end of the day. That's where it just found, like, it was like, it's not all about, like, only, you know, only do do do do do do do do because that's why I enjoy this. And it's also not about, like, forcing yourself through work that you don't enjoy to have a, you know, to have an economic bet-hopie like. And so I appreciate that it looks for, the meaning of the life of Victor Fretto, of both their, where it's less about the, it's more about the meaning that you find in it, and that you can see in it, that you can create it, that it is about, like, you know, necessarily doing one or the other. Yeah, kind of long-time. We've been talking about, like, the things between process and outcomes, and things are unusual to us, but, like, I think, about, like, everyone has a calling to do good. And so, like, some people may stumble across, like, a specific calling or work without, and I think, like, either I've meaning and passion, when I'm, like, set on doing good. And I think there's, like, a whole relationship there. And, like, from, like, an athlete's perspective, I mean, like, this, you'll hear this from the attention of every athlete, but, like, it's all about the process. You can wouldn't change, you shouldn't feel good for, like, five minutes. And then you're just, like, back to another offseason of grinding and working your tail off for 95% of the time. So, like, some of you get some more of, like, a passion of, like, finding good, and you see, and lots of people will enjoy this meaning, or a calling, and that, that's what we're doing. So, Bill, what James said, although I know how an athlete's perspective, I don't know, he's just trying to, like, you can run a gym, you can be, like, either, either. Yeah. LAUGHTER Every sport, most every job of every rotation would have speedball. And so, maybe, you don't want to be left with orientations and putting out, you can use whatever you're, you got to give them talents or, to help pack your people in the orientation of middle people. That's what we would put on. I think I love that insight. And it's why we hope so badly we can instill in you this sense that you guys are all leaders. It's not just hyperbole leaders or all leaders you're going to go out into the world. You're going to have the ability to transform people's lives. And I don't care if you're doing the PepsiCo, like, Christian, or wherever you guys are that go in. You're going to have that capacity, no matter what product your organization is making and what service they're providing. You're going to be leading them, you know, how to change the velocity. Okay, so, for most workers miserable, if you find your calling, you'll find this place of bliss and the way you find your calling is by following the passion. Over seven. You've got to follow your passion. You've got to figure out what it is you love, who you really are, and have the courage to do that. And I believe that the only courage anybody ever needs is the courage to follow your own truth, so that's it, guys. If you only heard your renewable, right. If you look at these kind of in combination, I have to trace this idea that you follow your passion and you find your calling, then you find happiness. I think this is paralyzing. I think it's so overly simplistic for most people. And so it turns out there's a lot of people that spend their lives job switching and trying to find that perfect job. They try to find that perfect colleague. In 2021, 47 million people quit their jobs. Now, according to one survey, almost 80% of those switched jobs may be great, great resignation to regret that choice. And a very high percentage of them have sought to give their old jobs. And so, just in some time, in this interview, I want to share with you guys some principles you've read about them that I hope will help us to just feel more settled in our careers and in our career paths. The first alternative message I want to expose to you is micro. Micro used to have a show called 30 Jobs. Anybody ever seen it? Almost a year from now, there's micro. I really think micro is just so practical. And this kind of doesn't have a lot of thought into it. The things I can tell you today to come with absolutely no agenda. The first is congratulations. The second is good luck. Everything else is what I like to call the dirty truth, which is just another way of saying, it's my opinion. And in my opinion, you have all been given some terrible advice. And that advice is this, follow your passion. Every time I watch the Oscars, I cringe with some famous movie star. Trophy in hand starts to deconstruct the secret of their success. It's always the same thing. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't have what it takes, kid. And the ever-popular never give up on your dreams. Like I understand, the importance of persistence and the value of encouragement. But who tells a stranger to never give up on their dreams without even knowing what it is they're dreaming? I mean, how can Lady Gaga possibly know where your passion will miss you? Are these people ever seen American Idol? Year after year, thousands of aspiring American idols show up with great expectations only to learn that they don't possess the skills they thought they did. What's really amazing though is not their lack of talent. World's home of people who can't say. It's their genuine shock and being rejected. The incredible realization that their passion and their ability have nothing to do with each other. If we're talking about your hobby, by all means, let your passion lead you. But when it comes to making a living, it's easy to forget the very truth. Just because you're passionate about something doesn't mean you want suck at it. And just because you've earned a degree in your chosen field, it doesn't mean you're going to find your dream job. Dream jobs are usually just that. Dreams. But their imaginary existence just might keep you from exploring careers that offer a legitimate chance to perform meaningful work and develop a genuine passion for the job you already have. Because here's another dirty truth. You're happiness on the job has very little to do with the work itself. Under your jobs, I remember a very successful septic tank cleaner, a multi-millionaire who told me the secret to this success. I looked around to see where everyone else was headed. And then I went the opposite way. Then I got good at my work. Then I began to prosper. And then one day I realized I was passionate about other people's crap. I heard that same basic story from welders, plumbers, carpenters, electricians, HVAC professionals, hundreds of other skilled tradesmen who followed opportunity, not passion and prospered as a result. Consider the reality of the current job market. Right now, millions of people with degrees and diplomas are out there competing for relatively narrow set of opportunities that polite society calls good careers. Meanwhile, employers are struggling to fill nearly 5.8 million jobs that nobody's trained to do. This is the skills gap. It's real. And it's causing this action to be very simple. When people follow their passion, aim a salad on all kinds of opportunities, they didn't even know existed. When I was 16, I wanted to follow in my grandfather's footsteps. He was a skilled tradesman, could build a house without a blueprint. That was my passion. And I followed it for years. I took all the shop classes in school. I did all I could to absorb the knowledge and skill that came so easily to my granddad. Unfortunately, the handy-cheat is recessive. It's getting right over me. I struggled, mightily, to overcome my deficiencies. But I could. I was one of those contestants on American Island who believed his passion was enough to ensure his success. One day, I brought him on a sconce. I had made a wood shop. It looked like a paramedicium. After a heavy sigh, my granddad gave me the best advice I've ever received. He told me, Mike, you can still be a tradesman. But only if you get yourself a different kind of toolbox. At the time, this felt contrary to everything I believed about the importance of passion and persistence and staying in the course. But of course, he was right. Because, staying in the course, it only makes sense if you're headed in a sensible direction. And while passion is way too important to be without, it is way too fickle to follow around. Which brings us to the final thirty-truth? Never follow your passion. But always, bring it with you. Congratulations again. Things I can say. Okay. So, there's alternative perspective number one. Alternative perspective number two comes from a scholarly and calvary board. And Cal has done a significant amount of research about passion. And he suggests that this idea of following your passion posits that passions exist a priori of any serious engagement with pursuit. There's some mysterious, plutonic form waiting for you to discover. And he describes this as a dangerous fiction that you just have to go find that passion. And instead, he defines passion as a feeling that comes from mastery. When you really master something, that's what he describes as passion. He says it doesn't exist outside of serious hard-for-strengths. I think you're right, Cal. You put it so. The you and I have. I don't see you're at the important people. It's a little bit of a different thing. It's a big area. Okay. Last perspective, we'll kind of have a little summary discussion here. This is Shane Lopez. Shane Lopez was a faculty member at the University of Kansas. He left that job as a junior professor to become a researcher at the Gallup organization. He really wanted to learn about employee engagement. We work with an area of employee engagement group. And I try to figure out how he could learn about work and help people have greater happiness than the groups. He's going to talk about some of the things he learned about people that really love their jobs. Because we need to make things. We haven't tried to make things. We also have a drive to have ownership and autonomy. So, ask you a quick question. By clapping, tell me if you've ever rented a car. Clap. Thank you. Now tell me by clapping if you've ever washed a rental car. Alright, so we have these lovely people who have rented cars and no one. Not a single person that has ever been washed a rental car. Why don't you wash a rental car? You don't know. It's not yours. Somebody else will take care of it. I already paid for that. Someone else will do it in my stead. That's a renter's approach. And if we have a renter's approach to our jobs, we'll never love our jobs. If we don't make our jobs our own, we'll never take care of them in a way that we can love. Now, now's the part of the talk where I'm supposed to inspire you. I'm supposed to tell you this story about how I left my job as a tenured professor to make a big difference in people's lives. Wait, I still lose my breath when I say that. Okay, I left my job as a tenured professor to make a big difference in people's lives. And it's a great story, but we just don't have time. Alright? I should tell you about Joseph Campbell and quote him, this wonderful quote, follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there are only walls. That's a great quote. So, I should cite Steve Jobs in his Stanford Commencement speech, find what you love, find what you love. But I'm not going to quote either of those guys, okay? Because what people who love their jobs tell us is that that advice while popular is misleading. It's misleading. So take the Confucian saying, choose a job you love and you will never work a day in your life. Sounds like something that an unemployed philosopher would say. Okay? Choose a job you love. Choose a job you love. It makes it sound like they're just showrooms full of jobs that you would love. And all you have to do is walk in and pick that job and your life will be much better. But what we know from people who love their jobs is that they take this job that's pretty good and they turn it into something amazing. There's also this wildly popular saying, follow your passion. Follow your passion. That is the most dangerous career advice we could ever give anybody. Follow your passion. There was a study done on people's passions and they asked people to name the things that make their heart pound. And only 5% of people, the name things related to work. 5% could name their passions. But you're supposed to follow your passions to the promised land. But that's just not happening. What people who love their job say is that they are full of zest and zeal and passion, but they created it. They created it on the job. All right? So what does that leave us with? What kind of career advice does that give us? Well, people who love your job, love their job, say you will not land the perfect job. You will perfect the good job you have. You will perfect the good job you have. And that's the advice I want you to hear. And you do that by designing your life. You do that by designing everything about your life so that your job comes to life. And the rest of your life is made better. Okay, so we'll take these three alternative messages. What is standing after? What principles are resonated with you? Or maybe you want to push back on things. You have a lot more control than this. It's from an angel for a dude. Find something and then turn it into a half-that control. Figure out what you're about to do better. Except just some of the material passion that you're chasing. And it's all just a bit of a good technique. So you actually have some control, right? I love that. You have some tendency in your ability to take a job that you have and turn it into a second. I think of looking at the philosophy of the dollar stewardship and doing what we can, or what we have to know to us, and I think it's a lot of consistent cost of things. You know, a job that you need to do a lot of work, you need to do a different goal. And I think that we're rewarded either making life and the follow-up, or all day, it's by opportunity what we do make the most. And all that. The line that flashing lights screened at these was, if we have a renters approach for a job, we will never do a job. And the reason didn't think that I had a job, my wife started law school in the New Orleans and then looked over it. And from literally from the time I set out to find my job, was I just needed a job. It's just a job. Every day, once I got it, I mean for this is temporary. We're here for a short time. I'm not going to keep this job. This job doesn't mean anything to me. And I never once took ownership of it to this day and embarrassed by my performance in that job. I had no motivation. I worked from home, like I would have rather taken it off for a walk, then laundry, then struck the floors, then did that job. Because in my mind, it was just a job. And I had that renters approach from a year ago. And so I think it's like even like my growth, these dirty, you know, you can get ahead of them on people's crap. Because if you let yourself invest into it and take ownership of it, I'm never able to put in the words better than that. Then that experience that I had also, sure made it a little bit better. Yeah, I could kind of connect this to the core bloom where you're affected. Because it makes me not get better and more than that. I'm not like through sewing the jeans, I've got a lot of things that I've got. There's this thing called foam mold, my ear, my mouth. Some people are in two different regions, like doing some random things. And I think not like the office stuff that we have. So it's great because I can't find meaning in the very small thing you have. And you can't use a thought it. Like great passion in the area where it's right. And I thought like, not necessarily doing the job, but out of this world can't jump. I love that kind of connection to foam mold. I think about social media, how it shapes your perceptions of other people's work. And makes you feel like, why am I not doing that job? I'm not getting into trouble like that person. I don't get the perks that that person has. Social media is especially a critical mechanism that shapes our perceptions of what we should be getting out of our work. It may not be entirely realistic. Yeah, I like it similar to Alex, I get to like the thing that popped up to me was kind of that ring frame of the definition of passion. It's something that comes from mastery. Like I've found, I think like different figures are standing in passion to be really stressful. And like, how did I expect to find it that it would just kind of distill up on me or something? I'm not sure, but thinking of it as something that it's like passion follows work and mastery. So there's like more, someone else is quiet. There's way more agencies we have in that process than just like waiting around to find it. Because instead of like trying to figure out what I'm passionate about and then get really good at it, get really good at something and then like, don't you come back to it about it. I think it's interesting and maybe on purpose that we have this lesson right after the worst job we've ever had lesson. So it's interesting because we're all talking about like how you can find passion day job. But I'm like, I swear I could not find passion in my career job where I was driving all the time. I hated it. And so it's interesting where I'm like, I don't think I could have found passion in that. So I think there is a level of work hard enough and you can find the passion. But there's also things where you're just like maybe, and maybe I'm wrong, right? Because maybe if I would have listened to the podcast or the ones driving that long by myself. But I just don't think that I could find any sort of passion in that. So I think there is a healthy balance where you have to enjoy the 80% like it to enjoy some of your work in order to find the passion in there. You can't be miserable, miserable. And I think and maybe I'm personally a different way. Yeah, and I hope Paige that the message here is not, you know, you should take a job out of UYU and never leave that job. It's like make that your green job. There are constraints in any job to the limits of where you're going to decide. And this really doesn't. That's okay too. But this gives you some tools you can try to hopefully apply before you get that point where you say, I'm going to switch this job. And then you switch your like, job switch. You know, it's not always better. I see that part of the work I think that isn't needed for that. It's one of the phrases one of you is, it's a quite a good job and then the master. On top of the mastery, you need to know all yourself. Know what you like, where and what situations you thrive. And once you've found a decent job, focus your work into those spaces where you like. That's part of, I've heard that I just say that it takes work. And I'm not afraid that you've designed your work to find a passion. But you might have decent job. Know your strengths, place them, design your work to find passion. We'll talk about this when we talk about negotiation in the communities. But you know, I always think about negotiation as financial incentives. Like, I'm going to negotiate financial incentives. Can you negotiate your role? You can do that on the front end. And once you get into a job, you know, we always talk about one of your manager to request a raise. That's great. What if you also go to your manager and say, I really want to do this type of work. Or I want to do this type of thing. Can that be a part of your negotiation process? Yes. If you have that mindset that I have agency, I have some level of control. Doesn't mean I can just go into an organization and do whatever I want. Again, that's not the message I hope you're getting here. But it's a different kind of strength of this job. I may have more agency than I anticipate. Maybe there's some things I can try to help me see if I can make this good job even better. So I like to summarize this. What I'll call job practice. I think an opportunity. I should put up here an opportunity to think is good. You can't always predict in the past. You may show up if you have a horrible boss. Or you hate the team that you work with. But try to take an opportunity that seems really good. And when you get in that opportunity, you take time to learn and master everything you can. And improve that opportunity and improve that job where possible. And as you do that, you're going to develop and learn about passion. And you're going to have new opportunities. And as you engage in that process, you're going to find much greater happiness than if you're just waiting for the job to give that to you. I want to show you an example of somebody who has applied these principles. And let me review these really quick. Because these are just regular details for your reading. But principle one is perception. How do you think about your job? Re-narrary your job. You're going to do this task. Change what you actually do. Add things that you like. See if there's agency or possibility of removing things or diminishing things that you don't have. And then relationships. I think this gets down to the point. Relationships of people are such an important part of any job. How can you use those relationships? I'm going to show you someone that, what we want you to see if you can guess the force you said that what she said that you didn't talk. And it's a while away to tell what she does. What I want you to see, how does she frame over through the link of perception? How does she add or maybe take away tasks? And what does she do with relationships that enables her to find great meaning in this work that she's doing? This is always loud. So I'm going to be able to go to the room. Well my involvement is basically with the patients. I'm a basically a people person. And I try and have a smile on my face every day. No matter what's going on at home or with the department or with coworkers. When the patients see me, they have to see a smile because you have to understand when they come here they're very sick. They don't want to come to an environment where everybody is finding and parting and there's fighting amongst each other. So I try and always always have a smile and I'm kind of a jokester. So from time to time, I'm not paying the attention to what I'm doing. When I push a card, I accidentally run into a wall or something. And I actually get a lot of laughs off the patients. And for some reason, they always remember me doing that. So the next time they come, they're like, oh I remember you, you the one that you drive the places and seeers. They're just laughing, laughing. So then from that point on, no matter how long they come, they always remember that and they'll start laughing. Because my building is the cancer center. And our patients are here to get chemo. And they go to another building to get radiation. And they become really sick with the chemo and the medication. They're here for many hours getting their treatments. So it's really important for me being that I'm the only house people over here that they see a positive person. And that the environment is clean. And I do extra care on the bathroom because this is right now is the cold season. And I make sure that the door handles are sprayed with like bywax and the sinks are clean. And I try and check the bathrooms every hour. So when they come in, the bathrooms always smells good. Not too strong because they're really so sick to smell. Because like I said, this is the cancer center. But basically that's what I do here. I love sick people. I had so much to offer sick people. Because when I don't feel good or when I've been sick or have had to have surgeries, the one thing that got me through was a very pleasant staff member. Jokes, just being pleasant, being a being, having a great attitude. And that's what I enjoy the most about being here. It's so upbeat here. In fact, I consider this place the house of home. And that's what I tell all the patients and that's what I tell all the visitors. This is the house of home. Okay, so what is she doing for her? I'm just going to have her visit the house of her in the cancer unit at the University of Michigan Hospital. And yet look at how she's changed. Her job, she's changed what she thinks about it. She has changed the task boundaries of her job. She certainly has used relationships to find a deep sense of meaning during this job that is really hard. Is this going to be her dream job? What she wants to do for us is what she's doing is going to help her advance in her career. It turns out people that job craft, there's a lot of research that shows they're more mobile than people that build. They create more opportunity for themselves by engaging in skills. And so it's not crappy for her in a job that's not ideal. By doing this, it's going to give her more opportunity in the future to advance in her career. So, I know these are really simple principles, but I know people who are in my career, who have watched it, who have watched it, who have probably been able to do those groups. As you engage with this assignment, where are some ways that you felt like you could pull the perception lever, maybe on a former job? Or what did you think in terms of how you could rephrase a former job? Well, I think it's something that connects with that as well as something that to me stands out is connecting the feedback of the people that are my passion, also trying to get opportunities. We are going to find a career in our job with a perception of it. These are our jobs, have a positive impact. Which is an increasing challenge we can do today at BC. The number of companies that consumers in general just don't really like these, or either CEO or plan it for whatever else they need for me when I'm putting into my job. It's only my work was essentially helping to affect the first few people, like it's impactless loss, it's not going to take. And I intentionally put some of my managers to look at, hey, I want to be more of this sector where I understand how I can value that I'm getting. I know it's more of a benefit than you, but it's really important to make a massive difference like how I can care for how much I'll get, believe me, that's a lot of. So if you're a client organization, one way that you can apply these principles is to really see out specific types of clients and industries or contexts that are more aligned with what you care about within your values. Okay, other ways that you engage with this assignment thought about using perceptions or relationships of tasks that include your experience. I like the potential of this type, really similar. It's the only amount of time you're being shrinking the box and then you're making a bigger, I think, it's easy to make a similar thing. So, so it may just be reallocating the amount of time and trying to find more ways to invest your time in things that you're, I'm sorry, I'm just going to push back a little bit here, like, I'm all going to sign the last line of doing a reading. I get it, like, the class I get the message and all that, but I feel like the diagram is a little bit passive for me, especially when we hear it, it says, hey, resource, a constraint, or promotion, and possible job practice, make it possible to motivate and retain the employees. And I was like, is it my job to change my perception? Or do I, yeah, is it employers' job to make you or to keep it for happy, especially when Shane said, if you don't take the job as we own, you will not love it. I like, I wanted to do it, but I was just diagraming last night and I was looking at other things I spend most time with, and things I spend at least time with, and what I want to do, and it's like, at a confront-wide left-of-the-trunking. I want to do the job, and maybe I can only do that job like once a week, or once a week, the company doesn't give me time or responsibilities, let me to open my company. Yeah, and again, I tried to say this before, I hope the message is now that, like, you should have stayed in that job. It could have been your dream job, you just worked hard. That was our dream, it could have been. It could have been. You try to see these things, you still work in Jordan, and I think that's where you start to get to a decision. I'm applying these things, and it's not working, and if that's the case, maybe this time you start looking at other things. If we got, let's see hands for people that are in the decision. I think one of my perspectives is, I founded your job, and then when I got there, it wasn't a big job there. I worked as a personal assistant in Hollywood, so people go, oh, you worked in movies. That job was terrible. It wasn't the people, it was just the environment and the tasks and things like that. I got really into stoicism at the time trying to think about things that I was in control of, and I found this quote that I has still had a staking out of it. It has water stains, and it's been through many desks, and it's been in monitors and stuff, but I wrote it and said, I'm learning every day to allow the space between where I am, and where I want to be, to inspire me and not terrify me. It was like that refraining completely changed that is the kind of thing that those tasks of picking up kids from school that weren't my own kids became kind of fun. Or restocking the snack drawers when I was mid-twenties. I was able to reframe it in a way that it was job-caughting without knowing that it was job-caughting. Yeah, that was awesome. Cool example. I feel like I really did a lot to it, being shared with my previous job, and doing this exercise actually showed me a little bit that I had more control than I thought I did, even when I tried to make some changes, I was like, oh, I look at that I definitely could have applied this, and given myself a little bit more bandwidth than I originally thought when I left. So it was like, I still think that there was some of those constraints in place, but it was kind of eye-opening for me to see that, okay, I did have more control than I thought I had in there for weeks. Joseph, you didn't try to raise your hand. Yeah, yeah. I like this, and I'm not surprised that I could do that. I did this, I was thinking about all of the things that I could do, but I actually did a lot of job, so definitely about it. Just trying to do this, not the time. The thing that I enjoyed was the very mic, it's teaching other people how to do something, and I remember that was my first job after finishing teaching at the scene, and I think you're here with Howard. It's like the best job ever, and I've been thinking about it for about the past few years, so I love so much. I've been trying to somehow enjoy a job as much as I enjoy a best job. That's been my career aspiration to enjoy a job, which is what I'm trying to do, you see. And I realize that looking at a kind of thing with the Oxford is classical. It went to really good at something. Then you can be passionate about it, but then you can also teach others. But that takes a lot of time, and that's the thing that I think is hard. It's like getting really good at something, it just takes a lot of work, and you have to have the vision. It's a long-term vision, and I think it's important that I eventually go through it, and work with this and throw it out, but it's interesting to have this. We're getting on really well. We're getting on really well, and it's a lot of fun. So I'd like that person to give you a chance. Jail. So I might be getting back to our first goal, but I just wanted to share that for me, for the women who are fashion, it feels like a privilege, because not everyone has the chance to be here in this classroom, and be able to be more career, so get higher education, and they're a little friend, and people who just need to have a better future. So I think that we should embrace this opportunity every day, and it also says in, I think, that really, that following your fashion is more harder than it's supposed to be, an easy way, and so we all are going to national bat or the other strips, so just give it a mind that this environment would you know, it's supposed to be hard, because it's going to get us to another level. Thanks, Jail. Actually, we have a couple minutes left, and this is usually a place where I like to end, but I think you've brought this up right now. We really are blessed to have a conversation with this. I think something to forget about that. Now we're years ago, what's it gone? We were doing a consulting project over there with a bunch of MBA students. One year we did it for Walmart, one year we did it for Ford Motor Company. And while the students were doing some of the research, I went over to this, there's just a series of stalls, people that made crafts, you know, souvenirs, and tourists would come, they'd walk through and buy the suit here, so these individuals, and I wanted to better understand how they thought about meaningful work. So I started to ask them questions that I would ask in the United States about, what really makes your work meaningful? And it was almost like the questions didn't register, it almost didn't make sense to them, that idea of like, wait, what work should be like meaningful to me? They weren't worried about that? They were worried about putting food on the table that day for their family. And they were grateful that they had a skill that had been passed down from parents home, so they could create these Noah's Ark scenes or these Nativity scenes so they could sell them. Because without that skill, they're not even today. And that for me was a really eye-opening thing to realize that you have privilege to think about careers through this lens of an identity quest that was about me being fulfilled. And I hope we don't lose sight of that, so thank you, Dan. Any last key takeaways before we close the video? I just want to, like, thinking about, like, Ying's comment, but I feel like as a lot of us are going into our careers and are trying to become middle managers or hire managers, or whatever, this is a really important perspective from a manager and how you can help employees have that engagement, because we want to give them the opportunity to kind of job craft a little bit and have flexibility within their role to expand, because a lot of times you want to keep them pinhole into their responsibilities, but we all have seen that we don't get a lot of fulfillment from that, and that's because a lot of turnover, and so it's very important that, like, as we're going into managing that, we're taking that perspective and allowing employees and helping them job craft so that they're satisfied with their roles as well. Like I said, they've done research where they've done field experiments where, with one side of the company, they'll just kind of use them as a control group and they'll just let them do their work as usual. And then with another side of the company, they'll train the individuals on job craft and they'll teach them how to do it, and they find that the individuals that learn job craft and have way better outcomes than the ones in the control condition. And again, like we said before, it makes them more mobile, and they create more opportunities for themselves. So I know these principles are somewhat simple, but I hope you leave today with a little bit of relief as you're thinking about all the stresses of the group. You really have one job while you're here, and that's to find a good opportunity. And you are using pretty awesome about how to find a good opportunity. It might not be the opportunity that you thought you were going to work with you got here. You may get turned down for that one internship that you think is your to get to happiness, and you're going to be devastated more of this. I'm not trying to patronize that or make a think of that's not important. It will be hard days, but you're going to get a good opportunity to win out of it. And then you'll have the opportunity to try to make that good opportunity better. And as you do that over and over and over again in your career, you're going to get to a point where you look back and say, the Lord has guided me, the Lord is the right to me. There are just not that many people on earth like you guys. There's just not. People who are striving to keep evidence and be disciples of Jesus Christ. And your healing thought that needs you throughout the world to have an impact and lots of different areas and places. And he's going to guide and direct your paths as you seek out an opportunity. He will provide it. And then you'll have a chance to have your own opportunities. That's a privilege for me to be in a classroom with this. If you can talk about these texts, thank you for passing this question. I have a question. I'm an experienced wherever you're going. So if you say, I'll just give you a hand. Thank you."
