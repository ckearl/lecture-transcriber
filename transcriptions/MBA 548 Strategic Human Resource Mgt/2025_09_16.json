  "text": "This person likes basketball. They were fussing and barking at me. In fact, running in Canada, they like Harry Potter and he would be thunderbolt. And they're almost, and it actually is. I think you're pointing to a little bit. There it is. Yeah. It's almost. It's the same person. It's me. Almost. So I was born live-handed, but they wanted me to use my hand. And so I do everything with my hand. It's that writing, but I've been training myself with my right hand. I can almost write as well as my hand. That's right hand now. Oh. Right now, literally, it's almost gambit x versus wall. So he does most things right-handed, but he golfs left hand. He swings a baseball bat right hand. I'm the exact same one as the one here in the bottle. It's a tough awesome. You just seriously, seriously. I'm almost a politician, probably not a politician. So here we're able to have you. This person is from Utah. They invite Indian food to movie Secret Life and walk them in. We'll use it the vampire weekend. Favorite book is probably a measure your life. They like to run. I think that's Joseph. That's Joseph. I don't know. I think he's a good guy. He's a good guy. I think he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a beautiful family. He does some power to your kids. I'll be home. I know the boy linked in and let's do your off-road all and then we have a little boy. And we can do that. Yeah. I'll be home. Hopefully you guys can pull that up anywhere. Good watch. OK, this person's from Persons City, Nevada. They like late night post date McDonald's room. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about my right hand. Way harder than the hiking emotions. Favorite movie is National Trip. I'm Treasure with the honorable men. It's not like almost any other piano five years. It's a great experience. It's a great experience. It's kind of like, wait, what? Did you ask a question? Mine is about National Trip. Oh, yeah. It's kind of not for real, but I feel like I said that so many times that it's been kind of not. That's actually a good trick to do. It's awesome. So, do you play anything about your? That's really good. It's great. You know, you're talented. You just can't remember anything. Oh, that's a good thing. Is that making you listen to a song? You're just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm not going to go to a song now. I'm not going to go to a song now. That's right. Joe's. OK, this person wants to go into corporate strategy markets. They like soccer, southern, Brazilian barbecue. No, he's nothing about Brazilian barbecue. I'm guessing that distinction suggests there might be the regional dance with the owners. I think we're the rings and they are a world champion in this work of physical. I know. Oh. That's it. You put good air of physical. That's it. Hopefully that's what we're going to talk about. What about you, that is you. That's good for their development. I know. That's awesome. Carlos says our insight for us. You want me to put the slide up? Yes. I don't know if that works. I can't call it working. Well, a couple years ago, I was working kind of on duty at a data amplifier before I did a low-key scholarly. And I was pregnant probably. I was a kid myself, young, young, young, old, old, me attending here. I tried to get my expectation about it. And a couple years ago, well, I wouldn't be too purified. So I thought, oh, that's kind of scary. I know that you said that we should be perfect like our forefathers. But it's kind of weird, but people are like, expecting that from me. Sometimes I'm just a freshman. I'm just a kid. And when we were coming to our class, a lot of people that shared people who were like, very ageing or maybe have done a few of them. But it was really interesting when it was stuck in some of these astronauts that had the EFI and the SRI or wherever. And we had a lot of them, and we were issues. We had a lot of less power. The leadership got me almost at fist fights sometimes. I had to come up with people there, so that I mean a system would get stuck. And that's the one that came to the key date. So I wasn't. And I think that it must come. It's like, okay, you can play that. No, it must come. You can play it in a good one. So what you should realize at the book is about being perfect. And the scripture can try to find. It's, I won't tell you guys where it is. You can play yourself. It's possible. That's when we were, that was the same thing with the better. It was done through guys. And yeah, come to Christ and be perfect anything. And then I ourselves have opened up the mountain. The shelter might ourselves have always done this. And they'll go to all your five minus three. And we have this great sufficient for you. But in my case, grace, you may be perfect in Christ. When the grace of God, you're perfect in Christ. You can know why it's a matter of time. So what I came to realize is, the matter of how to try, how to prepare it. The EFI, if I was a perfect cause of us. Because the end man and the end woman that made it perfect for them. On the same way that when we come here to the NBA, we go to our, this is affairs. The matter of how we try and come under, or as Margiard, is not going to be because of less of a slippery perfect, but because we haven't had any power that far. And when I got into the discourage, and I've also been, that's my favorite slippery chair. Yeah. So we're far really, a little bit better. I was terribly too often to get on your power. That means things to the other most assures, which is in some way short drive. For example, you could do it. So coming here and experience your life, is sometimes in time. Like, when you try to scrutelize, you can actually carve. And I remember these, if you do, I would be, or the part, cracking a drill down here. Things would work up for you to get. So, thanks very much. I'm going to be able to do a surprise thing. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Okay, just a couple of housekeeping things. Our next class is our Thursday. Your discretion of your team's social, and your team's chargers are due. Anybody have their team's social? Let's go ahead and do anything fun. There's a distraction there. That's a four question. I had fun, not many. I was just letting you help you go park. It's like this. It's a video game, and these old, these good characters, you have to go through these obstacles, where together it's kind of similar to Templions, except for the uniform, or dinner, something that Kerman hosted, and it's actually amazing, and a food and sort of families over there, so they get all watched, struggled together, so I can't do that. That's okay. I hope that these are good, body experiences that you really need to know each other. Yeah, and a question about the team's charter, do we all have to turn it in? Or is it one person? You just have one person for your group. As long as someone from your group turns it in, we'll give everyone our group. And we all have to turn it in to team social. Just one person for that. And don't like to stress about the description, just like no more than like half a page description of what you guys did previously, helping out with, this event in the super-stress group. Before next class, one of the prep assignments is the JDS survey, the job diagnostic survey. So we're going to learn a thing called the job characteristics model. This is a survey that's in that model to help determine what's called the motivating potential score of a job for you. And so I want you to, as you're filling this up thing about, the most humiliated job you ever had. And fill out the JDS survey. We're also going to have Dale Tolly from Parker Gamble, a class on Thursday. Dale is fantastic. He's also going to do our HR draft process on Friday. And no talk will reach out, meaning for worse and engagement at Parker Gamble. And they're a framework of how they work. And they're going to kind of add additional level of practical layers for you guys on Thursday. Tuesday next week will be a pretty normal day. A pretty execution report Thursday on a day straight up. And then no class on Thursday on 25th. So you guys, you throw a lot out to you. And so it's so nice to just have, and I don't even know if this is a break for you guys, because you guys think it will be a national black and rare stuff. But it is nice to have a break from at least school. I don't know if that's the term. So that'll be next week. Questions? I think it's been tough for anything you need. Office hours, so, or office hours are just by appointment. So my schedule is so wonky that setting a designated office hours will trick you. So if you'll just email me when you need something, and we can set up a time, we'll make that happen. So password for today's password or today's for just a short time. It's national black and malignant. Here's our clock. I also learned it's national, Mexicanated Wednesday. And so password today is walkable and I'm really curious about right now. Walkable. This is my calendar every year. This is the best day. I will see you at least every one. Not yet. I think it's a whole lane in places like it's not extra on this day. Oh, yeah. So, yeah. I could be spreading falsehood. Okay, you have an account. Yeah, I'm going to ask for it next. All right, last time we talked about the congruence model. The Dr. Witt input, spreading transformation process, outputs, and identifying symptoms. Symptoms can be internal because the engine is in our case, the Louis-Jose sexual harassment that was, it became public in case the motor was in the original problem to begin with. Or the external stakeholders not being satisfied with your performance. The process of taking stock of the organization, independently looking at the components, then moving at their relationships to identify problems and then determine from the average systems. Today, we're going to continue on this thing, the congruence model. We're going to focus on forward from that point on the transformation process. We're going to learn some different types of interdependence. Some principles were creating effective work structures around different elaborations of the bands. And then we're going to look at an example case that Disney Galaxy News. I don't know if I should be transparent now or later, but the Disney case, it's not like my favorite case because there's not like this really, like twist. Sorry, I don't sometimes. It just goes like we learned what we read about. It's hard to make this engaging, but it's also just really meant to be an example of one way that a company might design their work and structure around the band. So we'll learn some cool things in the process. Okay. So let's talk about interdependence. When we talk about interdependence, I says to read, to which team members are dependent on one another and get information or support resources and need to get a job done. And when we think about interdependence, there's four prototype of cool types of interdependence. The first one is what we call cool. This has the lowest coordination demands because most of the work is done independently with no interaction, no collaboration. And the major requirement in cool interdependence is you're going to have how do we aggravate these individual performances into the final output? So can you think of any examples of cool interdependence in the business world? Well, one of that comes to mind is, I mean, it's the case that we did in leadership with the Red Cross. The team is like pretty in report and the report is just like each member is like siloed contribution to that report and they'll just come together and then they set it down. For the report itself, at least they're not collaborating on a specific section together. So I write my section. You write your section. We merge the section. This is a nice example of cool. I think everybody has sales teams. We're a team, but it's really good. I know the team members vote as, and they should help each other in that way, not like that directly in two new figures. So sales teams are often pretty independent and the final number is what each person sells. But the aggregation mechanism is the key here in terms of the work structure. The next prototypical type of interdependence is what we call sequential. So this requires that the tasks be done in a prescribed sequence. And so the interaction occurs at those sequence junctions where one person or one group is then handing off their work to the next group in that prescribed sequence. The most common prototypical example of this would be an assembly line of some type. Where you're manufacturing something and there's a very strict process. And so the product goes from here to here. A team or an individual will work on it and it has the next. So that's what we call sequential interdependence. Receptor goal is sort of a cross between a pool and the sequential. There's no prescribed sequence, but we do have more interaction. There's just not a sequence in which tasks occur. And so maybe we interact with different subsets or things get passed back and forth. But this is what we would call a reciprocal interdependence. And then the last is what we call intensive. So intensive means we have a group of people who in real time are coordinating and collaborating to get the job done. And people do have roles in situations like this. But sometimes they may step in and fill roles that aren't their specialty. So an emergency response team would be really good to be able to do this. You have nurses, you have doctors, you have other types of staff. And being able to just, we've got a need here. We've got to be quickly. Everyone's collaborating in real time to try to accomplish the best outcome for the task. Questions out these? Okay. So as you notice, each of these have different types of coordinating demands. And structures or processes help us to create the patterns of interactions, a coordination necessary to help us use different types of work. And simple idea that we call the contingency theory of structure, which suggests that if I have some type of work or have some type of context, then I want to try to create a structure around that that will match it so that we can get the best and most effective performance. So that's kind of the foundation idea behind what we're talking about today. And you're reading, it talked about this idea of dynamic work design. And any kind of key insights that you have as you guys are about dynamic work design? What were your key insights for this week? Yeah. I was funding to connect to another class, but our op-stars were funding about how some companies get caught between having one of our factories out of it and as drawn as that of work. In some cases, in this case, we do a studio, and what they're saying is you don't have, like, at least in operation, you have problems because we were trying to mix the two. But in this case, it was a benefit. My benefit is that it's a two for the specific concepts. So, a lot of the things that we've been doing, like rigid black and white, like a hassle effect for a hassle studio, like why can't we use these key insights to both the head and the whole issue of the project? Yeah. Pretty certain areas of all, I think that the office is well-needed marketing. I think the work, at least my takeaway was, you know, we've not had the process, not every work environment is the same. So we're not going to figure out, like, you know, a bit of a team, what's the more best for the team collectively? And I think if upon that framework, what's my takeaway, you know, you're getting out of work especially. Yeah. But it's not one solution right up to you now. What work is really structured, and what's fine, and to be done independently, what work is very big, you know, is for creative, or requires high-reson collaboration, and separation of trade. And then there's this idea of a trigger, right? What are some examples of triggers, maybe in organizations you've seen, that help an organization through your advocate, were in factory mode, now we've got to go into a studio mode. You've got to even see an example of that. Sometimes the way companies are used in organizations, like the routine work is more factory, it's structured, but if there's a problem to be solved, or a problem can be created, it's still a poor management system, and it's not a company, and it's a good way to deal with it. You know, the other examples, just kind of a little counsel, or just like a weekly meeting with the team, as if the meeting is more like a platter of a meeting, then just kind of talk to your points. Okay, awesome. I guess it's others. I'd say like either customer or an internal employee complain to some kind, so like, something, reason the flag, like something like that. Yeah, let's get more heads in the room to tackle this specific issue, right? I do think it's me too, the more political intershaving, like, my career is not going to be that there's a lot of, like, somebody would have a client for it, or a client would have a client, or it's just like, I don't know if it's not where they are, they would be more serious out. And because it was the school, which we could do this, it was very political, okay, here's the paperwork compliant, relating to the service data, and that one, you know, kind of what to do with the online. Okay. I know the example in the reading was the, the pool floor, and the Toyota factory, right? Very structured sequential work. Suddenly there's a problem that requires collaboration. You pull the floor, you switch modes, and go into more of a real-time collaboration type of. Jane, in my first class, she comes from a healthcare industry, right? And you've ever been in a hospital setting, and you hear over the intercom, you know, go red or go blue, right? That's a trigger, right? You were worth stop what you're doing, come together, and you've got something that needs everybody on board. So this idea of kind of separating work, but also having a way to transition between the two, I think is important. Anything else that's got to you for the week? This is some of the reasons for you to take your money away, pretty deep, like this sticky-knock thing, particularly released it out, particularly because when you have, like, an environment like this, that is really meant to ensure cooperation, while also for the community, something getting lost in your needs, or like, a lot of communication, and causing a lot of problems, considering you're a little lion on a stick, you know, to ensure something gets done, to be so, like, high risk, what it doesn't need to be. Yeah, we'll get into the Disney case here in a minute, but I've always wondered what ever in this case, like, what if there's, like, an AC malfunction, and as well as a sticky-knock thing, it's a little bit sticky, right? Another important principle I think in this reading is this idea of decreasing learning cycle times, so breaking work into more rapid chunks so that failure can happen in easier, better, or effective way. I know it happened to me for me, this looks like getting my ideas out there, right? And doing it quickly, not sitting in my office for a month, writing something, and then giving it to colleagues, and giving their feedback, and realizing how I just wasted a month, right? But doing that on a really regular basis, that might be very differently outside of that community, but how do you reduce the cycle times for learning feedback, and making sure that you're on track? So, those were kind of the key principles that we talked about today. Any final comments before we dive into the Disney case? Okay. I'm going to pull up the screen here. It's time. That's all I have to say. Let's ask that one away. Errr, I'm having two more questions to tell you, a chance to reinforce what we learned last night, and also to have a meaningful day. So we think about the inputs. Some of the key inputs that Disney relies on, the animation studio relies on, over the next success, or some of the things outside of the studio that are invisible to the success. Thank you. Yeah, like what are the environmental factors to the history, the resources, and the resources? Oh, then because I was thinking like creating an idea of this. But then like maybe trends, or like what's the topic that factors to the generations now. Very interesting. So there might be like societal trends. That could certainly shape whether an idea or a story or a story, or that could be a portion of the expectation of the generation in the mass of the audience. And it definitely means audience to be successful. A whole lot of us get like what the reputation wants to be. Yeah, Disney certainly has a long history and legacy, that affects where they are now. Yeah. Did you talk about just like rapidly changing like technology, do you know what I mean? Yeah, it's not as a set of the way it is at all. Right? It's like intellectual poverty. That's right. I'll just go to someone. Finding. Finding. How do you all look like people? So lots of factors that kind of shape whether Disney is a sort of going in or all. And just got to that. You just, what do you think this organization exists? What game are they trying to win? What's their corporate kind of purpose and strategy? Box office. Okay. So we're trying to create. What do they create? So, what do they create? They create movies. Nature-like films. They're trying to create movies. That's what. What's their goal? They're going to be. They're going to be like audiences. And if we think about full Disney and we kind of start with old Disney as our starting point, what is the nature of this work in old Disney? What are the characteristics of the work that are in and drawn animation? Okay. So we're going to hand it on animation. We're just pretty tedious, labor intensive. I think you have drawing each frame in this. Pretty amazing to be about it. Yeah. It was kind of like a tech showcase at a starting point where it's going to look what we are capable of doing because they work out on the cutting edge. Yeah. And now we would look back and say it was low tech work because it was so labor intensive. But certainly at the time, they may have been on the cutting edge of the technology at the time. What else would you say about the work of the video? I think they will kind of strictly fall into narrative or storyline of whatever story they're trying to recreate. And right now they're trying to be more creative. They're trying to go out like the past, like the new movies that make like, still wild, whatever, even though that was a terrible movie. Don't watch it. It was a new one. So they have these storyboards that are kind of the initial part of the process. And this is really critical because after the storyboard set, then it's kind of a siloed execution after that, right? If you think about the people, any salient person, because of the people here in the big house, who want to think about the storyboard. Okay. So, here are artists, kind of storytellers, are paramount, most important people, right? What else? The technicians. Okay. We've got technicians that execute on that. What else? We're assuming they're hiding, and we're just guilty of what they created. Are you hearing that? No, we make especially here, right? This is where that creativity really plays in. What kind of culture that old Disney have? Competitive. What's that? Competitive. Okay. It was extremely competitive. Why was it competitive, dude? Because of limited resources. Because there were so siloed, there were things that were limited to each team, so that they were continuing. So, really fighting for resources. The other key things of culture, just question, so we're saying, what is the meaning of the Korean 2000? Yeah, before the case, they kind of described, yeah, in the case of the Korean 2000, they described before, some of the major changes that had been made for the nature of the world. Can I talk about how there was a pretty, really high record? Yeah, very high record, kind of status or higher record. Okay. Okay. And I'm going to break this out here. I'm going to bring this down. Should have put this on his feet. If I would speed some more, but here we have our kind of work box. So, imagine moving here. We're going to look at it. And the old busy work, some of the structures, the processes, the formal organizational elements, they set up that were aligned with, and then just support the type of work that they were doing at this point. And everyone had a primary skill set, and then set the period in 2009, and set the period in 2009, and set the period in 2009, and set the period in 2009. One of the characteristics of the teams is that it was kind of a singular teams, based on one area of expertise. What else? Yeah. Just for that point, it was just saying that they were like managed or judged on the output of their teams specifically. So, like they're incentive was just for the success of that team, rather than the success of the movie as a whole. So, a manager led, and if we talk about the role of these managers, they're incentive team success. And so, one of the primary roles was fighting for the resources. Okay. What else? Also, like their meeting structure, so if there are some formal conference room meetings that we do, especially meeting, also there were not lots of, okay, so there are lots of these formal conference rooms. And then you said, lots of one-on-ones. Okay. It's kind of a team that also mentioned that because they were working across departmentally, they couldn't cycle the animation. Okay. So, we're going to maybe come back to that as a symptom here of what's going on. Yeah. They also say that the little water working silos, maybe they share employees between those groups. I'm going to use water to paint all the other issues. Very siloed, the manager led, and making most decisions. Okay. So, very top down. Once the storyboard set, these managers kind of get their market orders, and they're kind of delivering those top down, and they're making sure that they happen. Yeah. Just even the structure of their physical space, like, they're waiting at the desk for that. How was it organized? I don't remember the mask in the state. So, the siloed is a good thing to do. So, the manager saw all the steps and the problem was, the beautiful spot here, all the way around. Okay. So, we're going to try to set elsewhere, right? They're going to come down out of their feet, and work with the teams, and then they go back to their feet, right? So, a lot of distance physically, which I also think creates symbolic and actual distance between management and the teams. Any other kind of key characteristics of how do they communicate with each other, or how do they work with that confidence that they would have that means? Yeah. So, in mind of this, a lot of their communication was based on these comperture experiences, and the table, and the team members, and getting the reinforcing of this very parallel history. Okay. Any other thoughts? So, one of the symptoms that started to rear its head was innovation, right? Disney went through a pretty long street of ordinance that were not very well received, not very popular. Pixar, on the other hand, due to Disney's adsorb in 2006, was highly successful. And so, Jenna, who's in our other section, did a work that Disney animation. She said that it got so bad that they were going to close down Disney animation studios, and Tangled came along and sort of saved them for a short time. But they were just insurvival, and they knew that, though that film was a success and was kind of produced in this old structure, it wasn't sustainable. And so, they were deciding to either revamp and revert or shut this thing down, and let Pixar become the creative driver of Disney. So, that's kind of the key decision that they were making at this time. So, they bring in these new leaders, and they decide we are going to blow this thing up, and we're going to do a really different type of organizational structure. So, what are some of the changes that they may going from old to new Disney? I mean, what are some of the changes as part of this? They gave everybody a chance to talk and sell coins with manager. Okay, so, teens were much more autonomous. So, they're more, maybe, what we would say, project-based. And who leads these new teams? Teen leaders who are largely building based off of their decision for the team, then their experience. Okay, so, if we come down here, we're going to have a Okay, so, some small, largely send the vision. That's going to be a really different selection process. So, we're going to do a whole new division. In addition, the team leads in eight percent more of producing and the three more of Mrs. Irwin Manning, two more concurrently. Okay, good. Why do you think that's significant? It's not easy to be letting the sky by some way you can do more alongside you and equally, I think, as a leader, you can better be the work if you're actually doing it. You have a better understanding of how I create a vision of working inside on the side where people look. Yeah, the look side of that is that the team leads works responsibly for funds for the users or for other teams or places or things like that. So, they want to line manager or you can really look a little bit different. How did they look different now? Well, just to what the point for Phoenix comment is that it allows them to work alongside their team members a lot more people involved with work. But also, at the same time, you may not be as a chemical two-year leader because you know I'm not sure if you're a hairier before you do so. I don't have any actual operations for working about fast and things for them. Okay. Other, it's a three-year deal. It seems to be about it's more of a deal. Okay, team is a bit smaller, right? And how did we get to this, I guess, small teams? Optional meetings. Okay. Optional meetings? And they found like, well, they have more than like six people they got worse. There's nothing. Okay. So, part of this approach to change was a very intentional very experimental approach where they would change one thing and see the outcome. Change another thing, see the outcome. So, they experimented with team size and found that when they got to anything over six, there seemed to be pretty significant diminishing return. So, they really tried to use the scientific method to identify a team size. Jeff Bezos, have you ever heard of a two-piece rule? What's the two-piece rule? The two-piece rule should be funded by the meeting? You should come to meeting. That's right. So, he kind of has a similar mentality on team size. If you have a number of offensive blinds from the legal team, I'm not sure. I've changed his results. I watched the Rex College football team once. We were playing big seed when they were both eager colleges. We were ranked number one and number two. And so, we drove down to see this amazing game and the D.O.E. football team went into checker-amon for the Rex College football team went into checker-amon. And you know how sometimes they'll put like lettuce to be kind of like a decorative garnish during the ball. It was gone. Literally, every piece of food in that restaurant, they ate checker-amon. So, I'm just not sure. And the two P-Zero holds up. There's no group of long-distance blinds. But yeah. So, small team size. And they kept these meetings very small. Was the inhibition of the teams weren't competing with each other anymore? It was, they were, except they were collaborating and trying to help each other. Much more collaborative. Okay. The physical space changed a ton, right? The managers ditched their offices. They did open floor plans. They had places to meet outside of like a conference room which caused more collaboration. And like, I talked about like the psychological effect of the formality of a conference room and how that went away. And so, they kind of designed the office the way that they wanted to to maximize their potential. So, much more open. Designs around creating vibrant and meeting spaces for the company means no more of this conference room stuff. But what about meeting to meet one-on-one with people? How do they manage that? Because they want, they still want to do how that, like, you know, all the space and innovation they created a separate room. They used to have an office in so that they could have more one-on-one conversations. Yeah. It's kind of interesting. The physical space has, right? The design of the space really matters. Look around us. And think about what is, what are some of the elements of the space? And how do they affect the dynamics in the classroom? What do you guys think? What do you notice? Okay, there's no windows, right? Kind of interesting. There's no natural light, unless you go out into the entry. What else? We're in the round. It's different than the thing in the big auditorium. Yeah. Okay. What else? I think that's back what I just see. I think you're on the negative here. Okay. Who's the focal point in this bottom? Right? The design of this crop classroom, see, it gets to the learning model, right? It reinforces the learning model that you're here to learn from the professor, right? What would a space look like differently if we weren't trying to make the professor at the center of the room? How might we redesign a classroom to reinforce maybe to hear the uniqueness as the primary? You do like circles. Circles, like smaller circles, right? What else? From the other thoughts? Facing each other. Yeah, you guys would be maybe more likely to be facing each other instead of facing this space right here and right. So you can see how physical space reinforces the values, the culture, and the processes that you're trying to facilitate. I also, my previous job was for a hand-made case show. I'm a fractional budget, but it's a piece of, not everything applied here, but I can say physical space. It didn't make any difference for these processes on the flip side. But we also ran into problems where, as mentioned in the case, that not being able to walk the collaborate pretty easily and solve problems that we only went to sketch only being at the sit-down. The object is very organic. All that was great, but we'd also run into issues where the media work done, this is something I've listened to in terms of finalizing our episodes. We directed your view, so it wouldn't work with me, but because of the lack of walls and things, everyone's very friendly with each other. So one of the other directors who walk by is to be completely distracted by the level where the reins are to some extent, and make sure to be the real for a while. I think that's something that really happened pretty repetitively. So physical space, there are some problems to it as well. 100%. What do you think would happen if you tried to create an open, shared office space idea with professors? What do you think would happen? Which professors? This is school professors. Probably none of that. So there was a university waiting for us that thought, why is it these principalities? They want to create more interaction between different types of disciplines, and maybe what cross-pony is, and they got really excited about this, so they built a new business school, and they incorporated, like, no faculty offices with doors as all of the shared spaces. And guess what happens? No, thank you. That was like a movie. I was in the middle of the school. The faculty members just said, this is not conducive to how we want to do our work. And so they didn't know how to read the work. So I'm not saying no. So I'm also from the animation industry, but Pixar kind of does a hybrid of this, is that you have the ability to do whatever you want with your space, so some people will add a door, some people will, but then they'll cross-pollety all their departments. So usually it'd be a department usually where to be. Well, now they sit next to sea, and you actually have to, in their design, their buildings, they will put bathrooms in between people, so that people go, and they will ask for the bathroom to be you, who are going to go talk, and environment will not be stupid. So there's ways to get around to things like that. Now it's interesting. So there was a study done in the 1950s, and there were a bunch of veterans who had served in World War II, that received educational grants, and they could come back to school, and they provided housing for them. And so they randomly assigned people to the housing units, and then researchers studied these housing units in the course of the next several semesters to see if they could better understand what causes relationships and friendships to form. What do you think was the number one predictor of a friendship tie? It's an approximate. It's an approximate. It's an approximate. If you were one door away from someone like a neighbor, there was about a 50 or 60% chance that you would nominate that person as a friend. If you were four doors down in the same floor, there was about a 10% chance. So even just on the same floor, the distance of three doors greatly influenced the likelihood of nominating someone as a friend. There was one anomaly in this step. There were people that lived near stairwells, and people that lived near trash dumpsters. And they had much more diverse relationships, much more diverse friendships. Why? Because of the very thing that you suggested, when you put people on the path of interaction in its first relationships, in its first relationship, in its first innovation in a business context. So major redesigns of the physical states are no longer managers being distant that they are co-located in. All kinds of changes during the physical states support this more intensive collaboration that we're trying to create. What else does Disney do here? The team, this is a different people. The team needed from the primary members and the secondary members. The secondary is a unique part here where they were somewhat focused. They weren't always in presence, but essentially they had skills that were helpful to call them in. Yeah, so we're on a friendly side. So you can have some expertise or even just some passion in another area. In a normal team model, that passion or that expertise is lost, right? It's not important, but they wanted to leverage that by placing people in secondary needs. What are some of the challenges you've read about and you've received with that type of model? I think that most of the time when you're passionate about something you're going to want to put more time into that and some of the other things are not in a balance. You're not putting enough into your primary project. Yeah, so balancing those two could certainly be an issue. I wonder if like employee turnover, I mean we are going to stay in the same company for sure, but team turnover might cause some like hectic change in the team. What is it? Yeah, well it says that they could choose whether they wanted a few secondary on different things. And so if you have a lot of people that want to be secondary on this, then you have, let me read mentioned balance in my three companies, but lots of people on something and then nobody gets help on the less desirable project. You have a particular, since there's a number of two things in particular where like the two needs more secondary spring and other. And so yes, they're colleagues. So like we need a couple of people to be back with us. Just in fact, in terms of what the team has to plan to get a new policy to push. These are the other kind of questions. You've got to be able to do that. Or they can be between you and me with each other. And not necessarily do. So if you look back, it's helpful. I'm going to make some of those. What about zero? I mean, I read recently somewhere about like the win-win over and effect on Disney and how like a lot of movies have come out and the music, whether it's written by him or not, has similar like themes and just like cadence and it sounds like it's written by him. And I think that can happen. You have to set lots of teams that are sharing ideas. Things can start to like merge and be the same. So who's your diversity? Thank you, sir. Sorry, one more thought of it. I'm marrying the secondary team. I really like it. It's very for the team members. And we do get to choose, like what they focus on. But coming from a product management and background, I can't help but wonder how it actually works for the team. And when they know they can't always depend on the secondary team members because their priority is the primary team. So let's just question I have on how they actually manage that logistically. Yeah, so you can see how this certainly has meant to inspire innovation and the pleasure of new skills and expertise that would be deployed in an obstructive, but there's a lot of coordination advance in this type of structure. Of course, those are on the organization's law. Any other thoughts here about meetings and coordination and how they actually went about communicating with each other? They said it happened really organically. They're just chatting each other up. And the collaboration is just happening. They run into each other. They just go visit each other at their desks and it happens. A lot of questions about it. Okay, but other points that concerned me after reading in the reading said that teams that just do informal check-ins that can cause issues, check-ins in the inter-situation which the entire team is not working for a common-based acknowledged across the student project. So I read that one that I'm right up for as I read this one. And there we have page seven. Most formal meetings were abandoned since communication happened organically. I have a red flag went off in my head like, okay, well, how do they say a line? How do they work in front of each other? I think along with that, too, whatever things like issues that I thought it was just like that really works for some people more than other people. Like, if you're talking about income to informal conversations, that comes naturally to some people. So I feel like there could be like a charge in every bit. So this doesn't have well-suited for it. So it's like, they're their costs. Yeah. I'm guessing. Any major board design like this, or redesign, you're going to have turnover with people that think this is not for me. And instead of change, you're selection criteria for new people, right? Who am I going to select? Under this structure is going to be quite different. Like looking more in a otherwise under this structure. Other thoughts, yeah? I thought it was interesting how they cut up like when something would come up. So they just call it just, or like, you'll find each other rather than like, maybe 13. And so on one hand, there was a lot faster problems over. You had a conversation with two minutes about the problem, so I don't know. It was really difficult for me. And so just kind of that expectation of like, consistent access to one another, is something that would be very important. Yeah. I was going to say, but not that is from a completely different perspective. I remember on my mission, the whole way of like, companionship and mentoring, and how I want to move. I don't know if I was going to be talking like, it was probably something interesting, not week to third day. It's not gonna be all week. You know, things like that, like I sort of, problems all the other week. So like, that's a week and it's like you can build it up and then you're probably like, you get to do that about this. I won't bring it up. And now, I'm talking for a whole lot of weeks. And you got to go to the next meeting and then you know, so I think you can get an eye on the big thing. Kind of with the background. Sometimes I felt like, as someone is like kind of non-compromotional with like, air personal things, it was helpful to have a place that is like, I'm going to do it very quickly. I don't know if that's the best. I think that's the best. Yeah, when I think, you know, if you look at the way they dig things, it sounded like most teams had, an eye-weekly structured meetings that were set in stone, but then a lot of this informal collaboration was happening. Okay, so, if we kind of come back here, did this re-or have significant implications for the culture? Yeah, before we change your meetings, right? You think it had implications for the types of people. Right? Your selection criteria, the processes you're going to create, the type of talent you need in this structure is going to be very different. So you start to see, again, there's not a right way to create a structure organization. Even since then, right? If you talk to Jenna, she'll say, what do you have? This was a very Disney-like case, because it's packaged like they were perfect for that. And she said, you know, it's interesting to see how so many of these things aren't enacted any more in the way that it describes it at least. So even since then, this needs constantly had to evaluate who you have to structure the processes you need to accomplish this work. And so it's a very, very organic process. It's something that, there's not one way to do it, or one formula that I can say, this is the structure I do. But I want you to take a few minutes, and I want you to think about the last workplace that you were in, what principles from today could be applied or be helpful to your previous workplace. What would you learn? Imagine you're a consultant, and you're going back to your workplace, and you're going to say, I did this in a meeting reading, and I had this really cool case, and I learned some stuff about designing work. What could you take back to your previous workplace and consult for them, and help them redesign the way they go about structuring their work, and what it might be all about. So take a few minutes, and kind of think through what you could implement there from today. And then I'm going to have you maybe talk to another person in the room about and have a discussion about how to apply some of these important works. Exactly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I know. I know. Take it. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry. Shhh. Yeah. And I don't know if we have an honor or even an emergency. I don't know if it's all I got left off. And then he chose to get left off. I think nobody is having an opportunity to jump up. I think I'm trying to make it up. I'm $500,000. That's a big part of the surprise. Thank you for how you were writing the movie. That's the point of all of this. What is the third best? Thanks, Sean. Thanks, Sean. Bye. Sean! Peter? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I will be writing for the first time. I'm so organized. I have so much on it. My previous company was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. I was on Chalve. And Alfred… He was on Chalve. He was on Chalve. He was on Chalve. He was on Chalve. He had been on Chalve. He was on Chalve. He was on my mansover. He was on my mansover. He was on my mansover. But there wasn't a lot of men who were looking for a better show. And so it became like a part of the deal. But it wasn't part of the deal that I had in the past. So I needed to shift my record. It's a part of the deal. So I think it's a part of the deal. So I think it's a part of the deal. And it's a part of the deal. And it's a part of the deal. And I think it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal.

And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. And so it's a part of the deal. But so it's a part of the deal. Yes, and so it's a part of the deal. And because it's a part of the deal. There is a part of the deal. But it's a part of the deal. I'm not sure if it's going to be a good time to be here. Yeah. Yeah. How did it start? It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It started. It could start. It could start. It could turn. it could start. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Freunde und Tapper I don't know if you can handle it. I just thought that was a good idea. But I was just like, I'm just going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, It's very easy. It's very easy. Yeah, it's extremely easy. It's extremely easy. Oh, I'm happy to be here. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what I mean? So my community, we had team at one point, there were team leads and it was really great, except the team leads did the administrative stuff too. And so it made it really hard, because the player coach mentality was tricky, right? Because it's even for now, it's fast. And then they switched to just managerials and you just have never done the job before. And that was the lack of respect, kind of, you're like, you know, I'm a hunter, my job, kind of thing. So I, my advice would be to kind of merge the two and have team leads who are experts at the job and can give ideas that then managers could do the managerial. It's a step. Okay, awesome. Yeah. I worked with the mentoring department. I believe the church is true. I just want to cry. So I'm afraid you'd say your comment. Our dean has been trying to create a Christ-like leadership course that would be kind of a required class for all of our undergraduate students. And anyway, I was in a meeting with him the other day. And I have some concerns about how it's being executed. And so I made a similar comment. I just want you to know I'm not anti-Christ-like. So as you can imagine, very, you know, the mission department and other quick-yellow book is your boss, lots of rigidity and hierarchy and it doesn't make any of the connotations that we could be useful for. And you got what my department could have benefited from and what it's a trigger that would allow us, because we operated a lot of things in a certain environment and instructors and instructors and we worked very hard to do that. And faculty mode is great for that. But any uncertain situations that bring it is a problem or a fire to use to put out. We didn't have a good trigger to go into student mode. It's all a problem. It was really inefficient to easily put it all the way up online. And it made sense. That was a problem. It was awesome. There's anybody that hasn't said something today? I'm just going to say something. So many things, honestly. So out of a team of four, two of us worked next to each other. And we, by far, got the most work done and had the best collaboration as far as between our roles and getting stuff put out. And the other two, it was really hard to coordinate. And they were much more shut their door off as kind of mentality. And so I feel like proximity for that would have made the organic self-problem solving so much faster and gotten a lot of things done so much quicker. Awesome. So in my first job, I undergrad, my boss's name, her name is Allison. And I like worship the ground sheet box on it. She was the coolest person ever. She really made corporate America a really appealing act show. Anyway, but one thing that was super awesome that she always did is she never really scheduled one on one meeting. Because with me, it was always collaborative. Like every couple, every day at least we'd had like a five minute attack end. And it was always just like, it would go on for longer than five minutes. But it would just depend on what the work day needed. And as I moved into different positions with different companies, I kind of saw a lot of value in doing that. And I wish we would have done that in those organizations, which I think reflects kind of the busy principle of kind of being like sporadically collaborative and set up like rigidly collaborative. And so that's one thing that I would implement. That's interesting. Awesome. Is the US going through? I like the empowerment structure. It's easy to, there's lots of personalities and different regions. And lots of people are happy to bargain and carve out and do their processes. They're like, whatever. And there's always more work to do. So different personalities, fancash. And if you have no concept of a team lead, and there's only a different structure in managers, like Big Z, they don't know what they're doing. They do know something, but not like they do the work. And so having a team lead that was actually empowered to sort of like tap community. Really helpful. Carolyn, it's like the last one. I said, you would be the last one. Yeah, I do. I do a background in healthcare. And it's really interesting to see how it reflects more like this. But just in general, like talking about the currency, I feel like this one's that higher than big, really helps create that controversy and a tight group. It makes it a way more efficient in healthcare at the ICU, where we were able to have a much better option. Because there's no hierarchy between a position I can tell my doctor what he needs to do for my patient. And that implies, in the hairless company too, we're going to have better outfits because of that. Well, thanks for a great conversation today. Again, there's not a right answer. There's not a right approach. But hopefully some general principles can help you to read whatever context you're going to use. If you're at public-grade structure and processes for your personal operation, then we're going to have a conversation and we'll see you guys on Thursday."
