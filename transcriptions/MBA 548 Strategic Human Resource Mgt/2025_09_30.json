  "text": "And just to close with my testimony, I know that as we learn to develop our personality as an art, testimonies that we will find success. And as many ways as me, we can find. And I say that in the name of Jesus Christ. I did it, cried. Yes. I kind of important cry to this. I'm what I call a non-graceful cryer. You're a graceful cryer. Thank you, everybody. We'll see you in a second. OK. Our next class and the next week are pretty normal. Just kind of in the routine of coming to class, doing your case write-ups, going out your registration reports after. I just want to change the password today. It's podcast. It's podcast day. You didn't like people who wanted to change. It was orange. Yeah, it's National Orange Day. It was orange shirt day. No, we didn't want to church. It was some Canadian holiday. It was about the impression of the Canadian school system. I was like, that's the same school you went to. I didn't do the research. So that's the difference. Podcasts are accurate. Anybody got a favorite podcast? I actually, when I called National Justice, there's one thought. I can grease your impact. I guess in Suea, who is actually a member of the church, he is a sports psychologist. He works with a bunch of his professional athletes. And it's usually like two to five minutes. He's supposed every morning. He's not gotten way more popular and way more people are not doing that. So it's not everyday. But it's like a really awesome way to put the target day across the field. I'm a humanities guy. There's a podcast called literature and history. And I kind of tell you the story of Western civilization. But very close to literature. So in my words, I love it. So good. I like the pop culture podcast called The Toast. And none of your girls too, but it's really good. What the hell is The Toast? He talked about pop culture stuff. Like keep their been in the cool kid minthroes. I wasn't there. I've been working for eight months. I was in the end shaking with your help. I knew I was too good to use. I was into a lot of freaking things. My college, my mom used to do no stupid questions. But you shut that one down. I was in. Okay. We've been spending most of our time starting on the work through the computer's model. We've been focused in on the work component, looking at its relationship with things like the formal organization, how we create structure, how we create work that will motivate and engage people intrinsically. How do you think about work in your career? We're going to start the transition now to the people part of the model. Today we're going to talk about universal needs and individual differences. And our discussion of individual differences hopefully will set the stage next time for thinking about diversity, and how to create unity and manage diversity. Today we're going to start by talking about some frameworks for thinking about the needs that individuals have. And then we're going to talk about some different foods and how to assess those. Hopefully we have a certain discussion along the way. So let's start by thinking about universal needs. Need-based theories or frameworks they posit that a person's motivation is driven by a desire to fulfill certain needs. And so the manager's job is to identify what are those needs. And how can we create a work environment around an individual that will motivate and fulfill those needs? One of the most well-known frameworks about universal needs is Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow positive that we have these different levels of needs. We started these basic needs which are physiological and safety needs. It's really things like food, water, place to place your head every night, security. And once you've satisfied those needs then you can move to the next level which is part of the psychological needs. You increase esteem, belongingness and love. And then once you've satisfied those needs you can get to the pinnacle. But Maslow's hierarchy is self-actualization. The feeling that you're achieving your full potential that you're growing and developing. So, Maslow's hierarchy there's a few things that we know are wrong with that. One is that it's out of date. So scholars have done additional research since Maslow kind of put this forth many decades ago and they found a new class of needs. Basically it's now a little white-eyed battery. You don't have white-hearted battery. We all know you can't be more familiar with this. You know what I'm all serious this? There's Maslow's hierarchy. One of the challenging assumptions about Maslow's hierarchy is that it isn't back to hierarchy. We know from research of people that are in very destitute situations that do not have their basic needs met. That they still care deeply about some of these higher or things that seem to fill those. So this is a framework that's less well known but more accurate. It's called ERG theory. E-sense resistance are the real necessary to produce. And these three different factors map on really well to Maslow's hierarchy. The existence relates to the basic needs, the physiological needs, relatedness relates to belongingness and love, and then growth relates to this idea of misdeed and self-actualization. And this framework does not have the hierarchical assumption and in fact suggests that if I get frustrated in one area, if I'm not having needs in one area, I can move to another area and have my needs met in those areas. So we call it the frustration regression assumption. So ERG theory, again not as well known, anybody ever heard of this before? Do you? I'm not having a memory. All that will be in this light. And this kind of progression of ideas from Maslow to ERG brings us to, I think, what is a really helpful idea for thinking about motivation or information we call through that year. This is, okay, in Kirk's bird, we talked a little bit about him on the first day. But he suggests that in organizations you have factors that are hygiene factors that will help you eliminate disatisfaction. And then you have motivators which will get you from, to, to, to motivate your satisfaction. And so if we think about ERG theory and how that maps on, if you focus on existence factors in a religion providing people with, you know, stability, security, enough pay that they're not dissatisfied, you can get rid of a lot of dissatisfaction. But if you really, really want to drive satisfaction, if you really want to drive people to feel that sense of motivation, you have to focus on relatedness and growth factors. And so they did a study where they tried to find what people talked about when they shared experiences of extreme satisfaction and likewise experiences of extreme dissatisfaction. And you'll see the most commonly cited factor that led to the extreme dissatisfaction with company policy and administration. Things like achievement, recognition, growth, advance in their own load of interest. You'll notice salaries lump together with the hygiene factors. And we talked a little bit about this with reward structures. But when you, when you pay people enough that they're not dissatisfied, that's great. Beyond that people want meaning they want growth, they want achievement, they want recognition. And so salary is viewed much more as a hygiene factor than a real thing. So these are hopefully some helpful tools to help you think about how do you create a working environment that will satisfy people with these. Any questions here? Comments? Yeah. What are they called hygiene factors? Hygiene. Because I think it's kind of like, you know, you have to do certain things every day to take care of yourself. Right? You've got to brush your teeth. You've got to, you know, wash your clothes. But those are, those are just kind of essential. They're not things they're going to really make you happy and lucky. And so I think it's simply an organization. So you've got to take care of these hygiene factors that are essential. But they're not really things that are going to make you satisfied with what you're saying. Okay, other questions coming to you. Okay, let's talk about differences. So in psychology and sociology, there's a long standing debate which matters more personality or participation. Any guesses? Any other guesses? First and first and last. Any other guesses? The same. Turns out both, right? You can call that the interactionist perspective. Well, individual characteristics and situations matter. If you look at kind of meta-analyses and different types of measures that measure individual differences or situational variables, turns out situations actually are better predictors of someone's behavior. And we'll talk more about why things are the same. But this is just a simple, not like a literal math equation. But just the conceptual idea that the person's behavior is a function of characteristics of the person and the character of a specific environment. But can we create situations that override personal preferences? If you think about someone that comes into my class and is having an intro book, right? That person's natural preference is not to raise their hand and make comments in front of all their peers. That can be quite difficult or scary for someone that was a natural tendency not to want to do that. How can I as a professor create an environment or context that might help to override that natural preference? You may have a dissipation, you may not be puzzled. There's a novel idea of graded. I can get students to do lots of things they don't like if I put a point on. So I can attach a degree to other things I can do. Students, different ways of focusing paid, smaller, breakouts, improve, breakouts, that type of stuff. Anything else for the way? Pretty class prep, coming in, knowing the topics and kind of talk to them. When you're here, hopefully you guys know if you raise your hand and you make a comment, I'm not going to come at you. It makes you feel like you did yet. Hopefully you know that it's a pretty safe place to make comments. So there's lots of ways that you can create an environment that can override the people's tendencies or natural preferences. There's all kinds of individual differences that we can talk about. When we talk about it, individual differences, we mean something that's relatively stable within an individual. But that varies between individuals. So if we think about something like self-esteem, Jorge may have a pretty stable level of self-esteem. And that may differ from my level of self-esteem. And that difference between you and me can help us to predict and understand differences that we see in our behavior. And so that's what we mean when we're talking about the study of individual differences. We're just going to focus on two. The first, we're going to talk about our intergenerational differences. So you see frameworks like this all the time, where you have baby boomers, millennials, Gen X, Gen Z. And much is made of what are called generational differences. How do you guys feel about this concept of generational differences? Is this something that you really buy into? Or when it's given a thumbs down? Share some thoughts ideas of opinions here about generational differences. Yeah. I mean, I think like the idea agree with it on average, right? And there's going to be a separate rule and it's the same thing with the personality you seem to get in preparation for bus today, where 16 personality to one, only 16 options. And there are more than 16 people out there. But I think on average, you can do a good view of what someone from this segment might have preferences to, or might be on, might be more than that. Okay? Good. Other thoughts? Just like it has kind of, like it's valuable to understand, right? It helps you to think about, like, let's understand why people are there in our hood. But I feel like it can limit really deep into those boxes, and it's like taking a little further. And it kind of like, if I get similar to our political parties, the similar, you have to like go hard one way or the other, you have to take one or the other, and if you're like, I'm kind of bold, you know? So I feel like it can be harmful if you're not like aware of, I guess, the weaknesses in that way of thinking. Yeah, so there could be some strengths and some weaknesses, right? And I was born in 1982, so let's see here, the living all, right? In some, I'm more viewed as more of a Gen X. And so, you know, I'm kind of a birth year that's somewhat close to the borderline, right? So it's like, well, is it fair to stereotype someone just because they're born one year or so or another? Other thoughts? Yeah. It's fairly US and Western Europe, it's a trick. So we let's put the boxes on it, put them in the US, but for somebody who's saying, like, such an after-hour idea or whatever, the differences are a lot, like, they change a lot. Yeah. So these might culturally bound, right? We often talk about people that went through the Great Depression or through World War II. And obviously there have been global events that would shape people in other countries, but they might be experiencing something totally different in other countries than we are to the United States. I feel like it's about closeness. Like, if I talk to my parents, like, I don't normally find out how very similar topics I can talk to them. But if I talk to, like, some of my aunts and uncles, that's similar to age, I do find ways to, you know, to find common ground that come in topics like I talk to you. But like, I just want you to do an event last night on the whole bunch of undergrads. And I was like, what have you talked about? Sorry, that was all. Yeah. I have that feeling also. Sometimes I'm just getting older. Yeah. I feel like it goes back to the art of personality or environment, or it is the last week I was actually talking to, just like, as well as being a much at national black conference, I was talking to a recruiter. And he was actually saying that for him, a lot of what people attribute to the bad things about Gen Z is oftentimes because there's a lot less mentorship and personal guidance of younger people nowadays than there used to be. Where you speak very common to have a mentor or your parents help explain these life-wise points to work on time. I think if I could have worked, that's a lot. Let's comment down. And so a lot of those common personality traits that people describe as a generation are more of a result of how that group of people are, how the rest of society has been during their upbringing. Yeah, it's interesting. You know, being categorized as a millennial and all the tax on the... Are you a tax on that? No, I'm not a different person. You know, talking to people, where did we come from? We gave her the parent and practices of being a little... If I were to ask you which generation you care most about the environment, what would you say? Gen Z. Millennials. Millennials are Gen Z, right? It's actually... Baby boobers. When you ask baby boobers, they care most about helping solve social inner environment in the challenge to baby because they were responsible for them. But... Maybe these differences are not as extreme as we sometimes think they are given what we're led to really by some of these dreams. This is the conclusion of a group of scholars that have studied interracial differences. They say, a growing body of evidence suggests that employees of all ages are much more alike than different in their attitudes and values of work. To the extent that gaps do exist, they meant the small differences that have always existed between younger and older workers through history and have little to do with the millennial generation. Think about Millennials we've got labeled as very entitled, and how do we view the next generation? Because it turns out when you're younger you're more entitled. You realize I have obligations of other people. It's part of the existing future. It's very normal. They go on to say what might really matter or are not actual differences between generations, but people's beliefs that those differences exist. These beliefs can get in the way of how people collaborate with their colleagues and have troubling implications for how people are managed and trained. They introduce the idea of stereotypes, we all know what stereotypes are, but they also introduce this idea of metastereotypes. A stereotype is what I think about another group of people. The metastereotype is what I think other people think about my group. These two types of beliefs or stereotypes can greatly affect our behavior. If we believe that generational differences are this huge thing, then we're going to act differently than if we realize maybe we're more alike than we are different. One interesting example of this is some scholars that have studied that involve training and individual auto technology. They manipulated in one condition whether a person providing the training believed that the individual they were training was older or younger. That was the only thing they manipulated. When the person thought that the person they were training was older, they provided worse training because they assumed that they weren't capable of handling our technology. What happens if an older person gets worse training on the technology? There is no more worse with the technology. And then it reinforces the stereotype. So you can see these self-fulfillant prophecies that can come because of the label that is how we treat them. So they conclude their study. When trainers believe that they were teaching an older person, these results demonstrate that poor training can be a direct, direct result of age stereotypes. The potential consequences of these findings are a large mean as inferior training can result in a reasonable learning and hopefully your hearing will be a good job. So just kind of an interesting example. We make a big deal about these generational differences. The research is increasingly finding that they're maybe not quite as extruders who think they are, but we hold those beliefs that these generational differences are really significant. And sometimes we can engage in treatment of other people that can be harmful or difficult to work with. Questions before we move on? We're going to say the rest of the class is talking about personality. Personality is something that we talk about all the time. It's part of our kind of label category. This is a very academic definition of carbon and shire, some of the most well-known personality psychologists. They talk about personality as a dynamic organization inside a person, a psychophysical, so it's both cognitive and physical that creates a person's characteristic patterns of behavior and thoughts and feelings. And if we kind of trace the history of personality theory, the hypocritees in ancient Greece, he put forth his idea that personalities were determined by four different temperaments that he will possess. Different levels on these temperaments affected, kind of, are your personality? Fortunately, some blood, yellow and black bile is in them. And I don't really know a lot about yellow and black bile, what that means. But there might actually be something to flim, you guys. So let me tell you about a study. And we'll see what you guys think. So if you get to know tacky tapers, I can take a life of that and it will even let it, if you can stick it, and then you can kind of ease it to act stuff. So these scholars bring different people into a lab, and they have them lick tacky tapers, and they measure how much tacky tapers they're able to lick on the first try. Then they expose them to a drop of lemon juice on their tongue. So one drop of lemon juice, then they have them repeat the exercise, and they measure how much tacky tapers they're going to lick after they drop on the next one. So here's the key question, has it released personality? Who is more likely to lick more tacky tap after a drop of lemon juice? Introverts or extroverts? Extroverts. You think extroverts. You think extroverts will lick more tacky taper after the drop of lemon juice than before. On average, you can see that. You can have one guess for extroverts, what's your reason? This is so outplayed, a shot with our extroverts, top more than introverts, so maybe they're used to like producing some libel with lemon juice. So why not? So what about the introverts? A lot of the same reason. What I actually say introverts, because they're looking at being in actual images itself, so therefore, extroverts might sit at a higher margin, so why not actually leave? Or as introverts might sit at a lower level than a lower level of alcohol. Maybe similar, calm mechanism. Okay. I've got a flow of like behavioural than biological. And it'll guess like introverts, because they're pretty much, is it finding the person behind the past? They're very hard to do the same thing. It's not just how good theory is to understand the causal mechanism here. I'm going to guess that there's zero correlation and you're going somewhere else with them. No, it's actually introverts. So introverts can more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more. The causal mechanism is stimulus. The part of the reason introverts get exhausted by social interaction is because they're more sensitive to stimulus. And so when they get the drop of lemon juice, their body reacts more strongly, produces more saliva than an extrovert. Therefore they're able to have a full-time. So again, hypocrisy is an awful lot of levels, but there may have been something that wasn't pure enough. It's just pure food. Right, and it's just a library. It's like a game of that. It's like a game of jibbing, jibbing, jibbing, jibbing, jibbing, jibbing. It's a character. It's a character. Now the individual nature and nurture. Your genes certainly play a role in shaping your personality, but so will the environment. They estimate that about 50% of your personality can be explained by preferedability. Your genes, which means the other 50 to 60% is explained by environmental factors. It's also the case that your personality changes over time. This is just on the big five dimensions, but notice how each of these changes across a life span. We look at openness. What do we call this? We call this 18 years. You're very open to new ideas, you're experimenting with a lot of other things. And then about your 20s, you start to level up and you actually have a tip later in life. This is conscience, this is the blue. So what do you notice people become much more conscientious of the worst of life? You become more agreeable. This one's kind of interesting though. On average, become more introverted over the course of our lives. Your autism is also the clients. I have a question. So information about your literature differences and it's very important. What are some contexts? What are some uses of tests that try to assess individual differences? Why might we want to employ assessments of things like personality, playing culture? So part of it can be culture. So we can use it for seeing just some of these other things, a bit of culture, but also building culture in the organization. What are some other uses? I love job-eating strength finders. It's like understanding where not even fit in the culture, but fit with the work that you would like to produce in a very fine, the most joy and strength. So trying to match strengths with jobs, I think another one you could do is try to figure out who would work the best in teams together. Team design. So leadership development assessments will be very, very good. For a leader to know how to approach things differently in one state. It's not really as good as it is. So for leader development purposes, these are all really important uses. How many of you have ever taken something of an assessment like a personal interest for hiring? What are those look like? What were some of these examples of the ones that you have to take? Or have they to maybe use this to take it for? Yeah, so I didn't want for a pretty good state delta? No, no, no, no. Well, I guess you didn't do it. You had your wife do it. Oh, that's right. Oh, that's a salad. Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no. This is what we're still using. This is like the value of this. What do you want to be working for? What do you want to be working for? This is an aggregate process. This is an aggregate process. Okay, so there are ones you didn't expose to the aggregate process. I'm personally a proctor of gamble. And so besides behavioral questions, they also test cognitive, they have cognitive tests with games and all that. They'll make sure you're focused and also have some kind of memory tests. So make sure you fit with an also like company culture. Yeah, so there's cognitive, they really test, they're all kind of, thousands of tests. So this is 80% of the portion by 100 views. First, how do you test? More than $1.5 billion. Really smart big companies like Kinsey, they use the METTI. People know they're METIs by heart. They work with other people as a result of those METTI scores. This is some, I think I tried to find more updated data, but for sure it hasn't produced any of them. This is only something about it. Suggests that executives are the most common context where personality testing is used in hybrid but also other contexts as well. So all the thousands of tests, I'm just going to focus on what you know are really common. But these are the only ones. I expose you to the big five, which is a great base test where you take the test, and it's looking for five different traits that shows you where you fall on those particular traits. The METTI is a tight base test where it's trying to take a combination of some preferences and bundled you into a certain personality type. That's a great list. You know, other examples of these. Let's focus on the METTI first. The METTI is a measure of preferences. I think it's really important to recognize this is a measure of preferences. References can change. References can change rapidly. And so the METTI is not a highly stable reliable test. You can take this two weeks for now and based on things that have happened in your life you might find out I'm a different personality type. And so it's important to recognize this is about preferences. Anybody have that experience where you have taken the METTI more than once? I'll add a different personality type this time. So you can see how that happened. The preference is it's trying to understand or where do you prefer to derive it or awkward yourself. How do you prefer to perceive the environment through the census or through more intuition and meaning making? How do you write a solution or do you more to the actual data or group formatting and how other people feel and ambiguity? Am I very tolerant of ambiguity or am I a good part of it? Those are the means preferences and the ascertainment. So if we look at the first one, where do we write energy? And again this is a preference. It doesn't mean that it's like that. Don't capture that. That's the correct answer. It's not like being social. We find that engagement energizing is more great. And introverts tend to find social interaction to make more training than energizing. Again, something they don't enjoy. It doesn't mean that they can't be social. But in terms of energy, they can be the dreams instead of a draw of my heart. The next one is since he versus intuition. How do I prefer to perceive the environment? If you look at this, I mean kind of abstractly, art piece. Someone who's a sensor would probably look at this and say, I see a woman in a green dress hugging a moon by a red letter, describing quite literally what they see. Someone who's more of an intuitive might do more meaning making or narrative creation around this increase. So, I think, a story or some of the background for this question. T versus F is about how we make decisions or prefer to write institutions to be better speakers. Focus on logic, data, people that are feelers focus on the needs of others and being in the environment. And lastly, not least, teachers are, are, have a higher exposure than a person who has earned millions of dollars in his whole life. Alright, sorry. Let's go. Oh, drop out. Just kidding, it was joke. She was already, she was already. She was over her. I'm super aggressive. I'm super aggressive. I'm like big five. I'm like big five. I'm like, big five, I'm like, big five. And you're super conscientious about my coolness. That makes sense. I forget. Oh, no, no, no. You're really a surrogate. You're really a surrogate. That's like a cheat. I'm going to show you the whole class. What I want you to do is I want you to bring it into your groups. And I want you to share with each other what your METTI results are. And talk about any implications you see that might be helpful for your group that you're navigating and semester working with people that are different. Okay, so take a few minutes. How do discussions group? Oh, I'm sorry. Do that again. That's a good one. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. I'm not you. Are you guys? Yes. I guess? I guess. So almost the exact. Yeah, it looks plain on the top. Just the James, we're just all trucks. It's a truck made. They're mine. They're mine. They're mine. Mine. Mine is the Keryl. Yeah, mine is the mine. I'm one. I probably don't love it. I was a bachelor of university. I was a bachelor of university. I was a graduate of university. I was a graduate of university. I was a graduate of university. I was a graduate of university. I was a graduate of university. I was a graduate of university. But I was a graduate of university. But I was a graduate of university. But I was a graduate of university. But I was a graduate of university. But I was a graduate of university. When you write a lot. When I write up. And. Thanks to a lot of media. How about we talk about some, um, I think. I think, Okay. Top 10 firstерse. That's what I always do. Okay. It's seven full three minutes. I need it. I need it. So, I need it. I need it. So, I need it. I need it. So, I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. So, I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I'm done. I need it. Sorry, sorry. I don't know, I was just staring at how I felt. I was watching a party. The only one ever. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. It's a lot of it was that. I thought I'd imagine. Lin-Tik-er! Oh my gosh, good day. I was actually doing that pretty well. I was working at this. Oh! I'm a rich man. I'm a rich man. That's pretty much everything. I'm a rich man. I think it's pretty much everything. I think I'm a rich man. I think I'm 90. I think I'm 90. I think I'm 90. You're a bell-curve-ylin' toe, mate. I think I'm 90. You're a bell-curve-ylin' toe, mate. What is the only pressure? That was really great. I'm a real rich man. That's really great. I'm a real rich man. I think I'm 90. I think I'm 90. It's very good. I'm 90. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going long enough for a woman to ride her horse, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot but I don't want to pay any bills now. I don't want to pay any bills really. I don't want to pay any bills. So, the cash is suicidal. I don't want to say anything. Yeah, I just don't want to pay, since you are telling me to meet your friends or Dave. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to create a interactive video. It wasn't seeing you, just seeing you guys doing videos with Andreé. I mean, obviously he's ... That is so good to see him, so I'm not going to be able to do it. That is really, really great to see you guys doing videos, So that means we have everyone there. We have all that, in my chat, and our Ziq's business, down in our store all of my life, and wish, I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. I'm going to be a little bit more serious. OK... I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go to the next floor. I'm going to go into the next floor. A to. You see the biggest personality type is E, M, T, J. I think you think. You see the biggest personality type is E, and F, J. F, J. so it comes in shoreline and all. I'm having a taste. I win a battle. I just know, I just know. I had a cue, I didn't come all the way. Four of them. We have one ESFP, who's our ESFP? It's not after it. That's it. That's it. So is it? So you're watching it? Did he act like Dick? Yes. He's not. And then he'll see some that are represented. How do you think just information could be useful? How could it be helpful to you guys as we're now dating different to the reverse? One thing that we were deciding about is in fact, it isn't necessarily what is needed. We're looking to see what the best way to get to. What they are seeking or what they are motivated by. And so I think sometimes understanding, okay, why are you taking this approach? What is your conceptualization of how we get to the end is going to be different. So with mine, it doesn't necessarily need one different thing. So it can help you, I think, deep personalize conflicts. If you realize we're trying to get the same thing, we just think about it differently. That's different than feeling like we're totally opposed. So this type of information can help you communicate a way that deep personalize conflict. How do you talk about this topic? It helps to know that there are differences in general. So I guess that's what I understand. I guess maybe you're aware that we're different. And I think it gives you a common language to talk about differences in a healthy way. So it gives you a framework for both thinking and communicating about these differences. Otherwise, it can help you out. That should connect with people. You might have to be the best country guy who years ago, we got completely opposites. So I know that I'm not like members of introverture. And I say, hey, you need to be like this, because I'm busy that member. She's going to be like, I didn't understand that. So I need to, I need to be more of the emotional side to be in search of doing exactly. I think that better. Because you never said so, but because of like emotion. So if someone's a speaker versus a feeler, you might communicate with them. Definitely like a highly database presentation. Is it going to be as useful as talking about the needs of the group? I'll have to use. For a group that a lot of the intuition, so I kind of recognize. I don't think anybody's expected a sensing. So that's a one-talk group. That's one of the thoughts about right now. The other thought is that my presentations, your meetings, all that, recognize what different types of people need in that kind of meeting with presentation. And then make sure you're starting to meeting your presentations and I'm going to speak to you in those people. Judgers and receivers, if they have a really strong preference there, and try to make sure you're crazy. Judger wants to, when are we going to receive or is okay with, it's going to be left open and maybe not coming to final decisions. So understanding that difference can be. Any concerns about this test or any concerns about using this data? So we can quickly go up. I think people can get kind of to attached to like whatever the test told them that they are. And I got the only 16 of them, like it's not going to completely define you, but I kind of put something to your like your horoscope and they're like, well this is like destiny. I showed you that personality changes, right? And so you can get total blindness or feel like you're bossing into this personality type of equipment you from seeking out opportunities for growth. And other people, if they know your personality type, might say, Jared and I can't give them this role or Jared's a J. And so you can become pigeon-wold into particular responsibilities. So maybe it'd be really good to send these. I have like I used some horoscope because to me, it feels very big. When I go through and I read about the descriptions of eight of the different types, I feel like I identify with like six of those eight. And so it's like it's not very specific. It's very vague to where it's very easy to identify with that and become attached to it. Even though it's not actually all that in sight for, but the whole because it is so vague. So it's like I've paid $9. I just paid $9. I don't want to pay $9. This is something called the heart of the fact where horoscopes are the same way. You can tend to believe in the strictness of the little personality that's a politically or a strictness of them, but could in fact just run at almost anyone. And so I do think, especially if you can be TI, you have to be thoughtful about the bottom of that here. Maybe not buy into it quite so much. Other concerns or challenges with this down. I just think anytime there's a classic patience, I think people are really complex. And there's such a wide spectrum of experiences and factors that determine somebody's, the behavior and personality that is really hard to classify them with some more work. I've seen, it's my life with tracks from the MBA, I've kind of seen some of this, or it's like, oh, your nature retracts with something. It's like a finance track person, so this must be true value inside. That's just a box that we checked, similar to our application. So just being careful with how we're classified people, I think some kind of, so a stereotype that can be dangerous, right? And think, I mean, think about the METI measures, how many preferences? Four, right? Are these the right preferences to measure? What are they not measuring? So I think you're right, people are very complicated, so if you're trying to boil it down, this helps, the simplification has utilities. Sometimes it also has consequences. Just as a warning, go ever use the METI in hiring. METI can open you to legal discrimination lawsuits that use it in hiring. Some of you may have taken it as part of the hiring process. They just know that they can give you trouble if you do that in a hiring context. It's also not predictive of job performance. It can be somewhat predictive of kind of team fit, and that sort of thing. But it has no correlation with job performance at all. And the research foundation that the METI is based on is not real solid. And so I think you can learn a lot about yourself. You can learn about other people if you just commonly wish to talk about differences, which has utility, but the METI is widely used, but it's also one you have to be really careful of, and you don't internalize the results too much. Okay, the other one I expose you to is the big five. The big five is five. They've more recently switched neuroticism, which I think has a negative balance to it, to the opposite of emotion, stability, or need for stability. Do you ever want to remember this one way to really easily notice this motion? I would say, you know, openness, consciousness, extroversion, and rehabilitation, and responsibility. We'll just run through a really quick openness, curious, creative, original, intellectual, and open-to-be ideas, because we've got good post-its, you know, right all the time. Consciousness, organized, systematic, control, and clinical, achieved with oriented, extroversion, and outgoing, top of the social and enjoying social situations. Agribleness, half of all tolerance, is the interesting kind of warmth. And disability is stable, composed of boys versus anxious, irritable, temperamental or moody. Sometimes students score high under a lot of cis-emberney first of the year, they score low on me first of the year. And they're unburved by that, and say the decline is over time, likely to decline in your life as well. When coupled with high-consciousness, it's actually a really powerful combination. So many of you, you're very highly-consciousness and you score high under a lot of cis-emberney. And just on itself, the honestly mentioned has some of the first grade. It would be more realistic in your first decision, also have more indapetian, and see things, and the ones that other people, so don't stress, you score high under a lot of cis-emberney. Let's look at your guys' scores. So I'm working. Well. Let me see that, okay. So you'll notice, compared to Section 2, you guys are less open. No. No. No. As someone that's teaching a required class, I'm like, look, but you're also more open than my business students. So my business score, an average of 43, you guys were quite. A bunch of inches, yes. You and Section 2 are almost identical in terms of the conscientiousness of my business, are a little bit more conscientious. It actually bears out. They're like, just like the student's under your ass. Maybe it's that similar score going on. Extroperision. My Section 2 is slightly more extroverted than you guys. You're more introverted, extroverted, who is to my business section? I think that's pretty similar. In agreeableness. Section 2 is just a little bit more agreeable. Yeah, I probably. Very similar levels of the extroverted. So, you're right. It's interesting if you look at MBAs, you have certain dimensions where you have different levels than my business. I used to teach math students, Monty's brother Austin with the Mac program. He was actually my TA for two years. And when you look at accounting students, way lower on openness, way lower on agreeableness, it's going to be more insured. Highly conscientious and mortar-opt. So, you can certainly see selection effects in the programs. Fair out in these first-time agencies. I was trying to come to the list. Like, he used to do it. I'm good. That's great. And I like that Corbin brought her attention to this. Just recognize Yan came into class. He's like, I'm a psychopath. I'm a psychopath. I'm a very poor soldier, really bad. I like, they're not bad. There's not a bad personality type, right? Okay, to be fair, it says, I'm highly agreeable with people, but I'm close-minded. That's all I can say. I'm talking to you, but I don't agree with you. There's some strengths to be more close-minded. There's things that's being too open. So, I really like this reading, just because it helps you to remember and recognize that there's different strengths associated with every single one that's quality. There's different potential weaknesses. Every single one of them. And so, I'm just thinking through what those strengths and weaknesses might be for you, and how to mitigate those and think, or capitalize on them. This is really important. Questions, comments? I found it, I had like a seven on agreeableness. And so, it's like the description is like, you're not warm blah, blah, blah. And I find that interesting to me. I'm like, I think I'm pretty warm, but actually that my husband, who is from the US, is like, you're pretty cold. It's people first meet you. And I'm like, I think that's just a product of where I'm from, where I grew up. Because it's just, you don't smile at people on the street. And that's not me, but if we're friends, I'm your writer-die kind of thing. So, at first I was pretty effing. No, you can start to see cultural gowns and cultural differences. And that's certainly the fact where you score. And I think that's the very interesting thing. Other thoughts about what they find in your experience? They can't get that back. So, my opening is two. He's an accountant. Which makes me... Which makes it, I think you really come down to families as you're a chef. I think my parents got divorced. And we've been bankrupt. I think that in fact, we need to be more conservative. And I also think, like, my job as a accountant was a maybe more conservative than before. And I think also grew up in China, which was a very creative environment in school-wise. And that also made me less open-minded, but I think that something can change. So, I think that's what you can know that. I look at this, there's not a wide deal of hope, too. It was like, wow, I really have something that can work out, personally. So, it'll take it as a given. I love it that Dr. Cumberzor says, see-gapher gets it off. This is to say, you're giving it a gap. Sorry, but that's it. See-gapher, right? So, this is what makes you use this to help yourself learn to exercise muscle. And that's what I was going to do. And you can use this to exercise yourself. But that's, yeah. One question. I was intrigued by some of the questions that I think you used to assess this. One of them being that you consider yourself a little bit more role. Is there insight into that as to personality types of food? Is it suited when you have a whole new supply-pversed system? Yeah. So, this was in the big bio. So, somebody asked me about this in my business section. I didn't remember that question being in there. My wonder is if they're collecting data, trying to correlate personality with political affiliation. But I don't think that's a standard. So, it's more big-five percent. I said it's range for gender benefit. Yeah, it might be more of like a question to try to be. Yeah, we also don't know how it should be. It's an interesting conversation. That's an interesting talk. I think, because I've got a different big-five, previously, we're actually for each section. I've got five more sections. And I want to say that at least for that one, under the open section, there was like a, not from liberal politically, but almost like a liberal, and just willing to try out these different things. And I feel like there was kind of at least a particular kind of connection with that in brush lines. Because I feel like there's at least a prescription that a general people who are a little bit liberal are more open to new ideas, to some price-like things. Yeah, it could be. I don't think you would get it right. Okay, so as you think about using the big-five, the big-five, it does correlate with job performance. The characteristic that they're most often look like normal when they have you do this in the higher-classness as country-ishness. They also, people sometimes say, well, what if you're faking, what if I'm not giving you your actual answers? There's some interesting data that shows the people that can fake the personality test and guess what the organization's looking for. That actually correlates with job performance. Thanks, guys. That makes sense to do better. Or work. Oh, you can read the situation. I'm finding this job. I think it's looking for, and this is something that you can try to do. It's probably going to be a good one for you. I don't know if that's the case. I'm going to try to find it. I've drawn a research foundation that comes up to store you to illegal flyability. So you can use the big five in the higher-classness. The other characteristics are less predictive overall of job performance. But if you do a job analysis and you think this is a role that openness really would matter for that data can also be profitable. What country is this across the borders of future predictor job performance? And the other ones it's more dependent on the job, which are what do you use us today? Has there been any research on people taking these tests right after the stressor thing? And things because we've talked about situation in terms of personnel. The IVTI can vary wildly depending on the context of what's happening in your life. The big five is more stable. And so it's a more reliable measure. I think we've probably missed anything. Doesn't mean you might not see changes, but it's much more stable. What are your thoughts on the... was the INIogram I do? It's called a personality test. I'm curious to do that. I like that you get different numbers. And I don't know. I thought that it kind of matches your health. Yeah, I mean there are hundreds of these in all kinds of different forms. These are the two most common. So I don't necessarily have a huge group of familiarity with that one. But let me give you a resource. As you're thinking about using things like this in the future, it's really important to know the research that these are based on. Because big companies, smart companies, have paid millions and millions of dollars to sell wall suits based on the assessments that they use in selection processes. Make sure that you do local validation studies. So look with your organization. Do the results of this predict important outcomes? Do that before you use it in a hiring process? And these two resources can be really helpful. The Burrow Center is headed by University of Nebraska. And they have reports on thousands of different assessment tests that you could use. And then Sherman has a talent assessment center, its mortality. And they have a lot of really well-abetted selection assessments that you can use. And so these are two really helpful resources that you can figure out. Is this a good test to use? There's a good test to use. Any other questions? Okay, last quote here. 75 members of the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council rated self-progress as the most important capability for leaders to develop. So I hope you'll take what we've done today. Hopefully you see some HR and implications. But also just for you as a professional, take the data that you gather about yourself. And use it to learn. Don't let it pigeonulate you. Don't let it box you in. Don't let it allow others to box you in. But just use that chance to learn about yourself. Learn about other people. Communicate in a personalized way about consciousness and this is your business. And let it help you to be better professional. And there's student here in the program. So thanks for the awesome discussion. We'll see you in the next video."
