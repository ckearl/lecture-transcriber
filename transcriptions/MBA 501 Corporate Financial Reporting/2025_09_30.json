  "text": "I thought we'd spend a couple of minutes talking through some of the words and insights you've learned from Al Dario, a man who I deeply thought was a liar. Here are a couple of quotes that I want to share, but what are some insights that you have gained from President Dario specifically? One are two bullet points or even key words that come to mind when you think of yes or no. He really focused on having personal revelation and taking personal accountability for your testimony as opposed to relying on the church. Yes, I love it. Finding your own personal revelation and taking full accountability for your own testimony is beautiful. What else? Absolutely. We're kind of in this great way. Yeah, but something we need at all times in all places, one that was focused around. Being a peacemaker and avoiding contention. It's not amazing. Such a pancreatic commentary for him. I feel like he sort of elevated that word. It's not a word that... Obviously, it's obviously crazy important, but not something that I feel like was in our common parlance in our culture and he's brought into the forefront of life. He has started his ministry talking about having the end in our minds in the English language. Yes, yes. Beginning with the end of my life, thinking celestial, making decisions based on a very long run basis. I love that. Such good vibes. Please let the restoration is ongoing and it didn't end in the day. It's beautiful. Yeah, that's amazing. I think we are part of the restoration. We're connected, members and participants in the history of this past year. I think Joy is the big one that was focused on. I like Kate's also. And that was also just been by not only words, but I think it was like the picture I was working with on this thing. And he's like, like, silence of it. Pretty amazing. I agree. It was a message she shared and a lie of peace. It's just, you just see Joy kind of. So it's such a good lie. I just want to keep figure that. Like, we're still figuring out, keep figure that out. It's such a good example for us. I just wanted to share my testimony of him as a prophet. He's fair to say that his words and guidance, an example of change my life for the better. And I'm grateful to be led by the better guidance and the poor guidance. This man, President Nelson, shared that experience with Jesus Christ. From that, we'll switch to, like, mode of taking a minute to get the slides down. Let's talk about big-term experience one. Yes. So the notice, the branding, some of you guys are marketing for today. I'm clearly not. We're going to rebrand this. The number one is big-term example one. We're going to call it big-term experience one. Not an accident. The idea that I have in mind for this experience, so to speak, is more about your learning and your growth than it is about assessment. So of course, there's an evaluation piece to this. But if you look at the points attached to it, it's not huge right? And so for this particular one, we're going to call this experience. The goal is, or we've been now, after today through four weeks of classes, let's just take a moment to regroup, revisit what we've learned over the past four weeks together. So this is what the experience is going to look like. It opens today at 11. Closes next Tuesday at midnight. Next Tuesday is when we typically have fast, we won't have fast in person. So use that time. Use yourself to breeding room, additional stay room. Even if you need to take the exam, during that time, just get you a tiny bit more bandwidth to approach this experience. What is it? Well, we've covered four topics. There's 20 problems, basically five problems for topic. Mostly equal weight enough, perfectly equal weight, but close enough that I'm comfortable saying it's in the right balance. So the first day we come to balance you, second day the income statement, third day the management statement effects, fourth day, today you're having a right. Math was on there, five ish problems for each of those. It is a take home exam, meaning you do it on your own, at your own discretion and leisure. So whenever you decide to sit down and start it, it is time. So the three hour you can't just do it for a whole week. It's a three hour time exam. So be cautious when you click in and start it. That's when it begins, next time, for three hours. I don't think there will be some of you to take the full three hours and it's totally fine. Personally, I'm actually a fairly slow test taker, so I'm with you on that. Some of you are going to finish it in an hour or 20 minutes. So we're going to take all three. But it gives you enough, I think, flexibility that if there's a few questions that you need to retool on or dig deeper on, you can. And with that in mind, it's an open, sort of open exam, so to speak, an open experience, meaning anything from MBA 501 or anything is allowed. The handouts, the textbook, the slides, the pre-class readings, the assignment, the learnings, the problem sets. All of those are fair game, open game, use them, and learn from them. Again, that's the goal of this experience. What it's close to, other people, right? So don't talk about the content of other people. It's close to the internet, AI, other textbooks, prior years. Basically, it's just you and all of your stuff that you've built for this class. You're prepared to use this. What question is going to help answer this? Well, it'd be pretty similar format to our problem sets. Very similar format to the problem sets. And you know the problem sets, some of them are easier, some of them are a little longer. It's kind of that too. Some are going to be a little easier. They'll take you 90 seconds, some are going to take you five minutes. Other questions, please. Could we, maybe everyone knows the answer to this? Could we access our problem sets after you submit them? They're designed to allow you to access them after the deadline. So if not, shoot me an email. I'll open it. We've got to make sure there are moments to you. I want you to be a last. They work. I see lots of red online. Thank you. Good. Thanks. Other questions. So that is a good resource. And I'm glad this is a good answer. Let me know how you make sure that you're all free. Okay, like I said, it's meant to be an experience. Not an easy experience, but an experience where you learn and grow from it. I'm finding that if I were to wait and put all the weight on the final exam only, you just forget, right? If you tell me something, all that's are 90 minutes from now, I won't remember it. So my wife will say, hey, you're driving Josie to cheer back as a six. And then an hour later, I'm like, when am I driving Josie? At six and then two hours later. What was that? Is six o'clock? Is that what you said? I don't know if you're like me. My brain sometimes is just like an empty shell. And so the idea of this is we're a month in. Let's take some time. Let's revisit. Let's make sure that we're understanding how we're ending. Because I want this to stay. I want this stuff to do something that I do is use it here. I'm actually an MBA program. That's the whole goal of your peer to learn. Not just to get a credential. You're here to learn and to grow and build your own intellectual, sweet or free. Okay, with that, let's learn something new. Okay, let's learn revenue recognition. I've got a handout for you. On revenue recognition. I'll just take one down and pass it around and send them up and back. Send them everywhere. And I can't think of all this. Send them all around. Spread them out. What do you think is the most important thing to do? There's no, I mean, there are all the minutes you're about to. So we have just a second. One more quick name. So higher is our team. I have another TN hired and shipped a foul out because of just busyness. So I'm in the process of finding one other TA. I actually literally emailed nine other MBAs within the last year as you've been getting one of all. Turns out pretty busy during an MBA program. So they all basically said I'd love to, but I can't. So I'm pulling someone in from the online program. She's awesome. She just finished teaching the MTC. She's like, just got this wonderful personality. And she'll be working through, so I'm going to try to get her started this week. And I guess we're going to have to connect her to Slack. Anyways, we're working on a more TA support to help support you in that. But there will not be like an organized review session just in normal hours that they've hired us. Alright, are we going to hand out? I think I've got more of a more paper. I'll congratulate you. Okay, so revenue recognition is an interesting concept. These are words that we all have used, but rarely together. You know, kind of have a sense for what revenue is. We have a sense for what recognition is. But what does it mean when you put the two together? Well, that's what today is all about. It is the recognizing of revenue. Okay? So every company is different. Every company generates revenue in their own form, in their own timing, with different customers and contracts and organizations. And that actually leads to some complexities in how and how much revenue is recognized. So when I say recognize and account, it actually is kind of unique phrasing. Recognize you if you're walking your dog into your neighborhood, and you recognize someone, you wave, you smile. That's different. There's no wave in a smile with revenue recognition. What it means is to put on the income statement. To put it very blunt, sort of, roughly, to recognize revenue means we actually put it on the income statement. Where it particular period at a particular time. So what we're going to do today, you know, that sounds kind of easy. We're going to try to build intuition about this process. And it's a series of many cases today where we go through four or five cases. We start with kind of a base case, which is the most common revenue recognition model, which is just a point of sale transaction. And we're going to layer on challenges and difficulties and complexities because different business models are different. So we're going to look at different business models and how they might consider recognizing revenue. So what would you do to the most common revenue recognition methods? And I think by the end, we'll have covered most of the sectors, industries, and companies, types that you guys are going to be exposed to in your careers. So let's get some definitions down. First definition. What is revenue? In very formal terms, revenue is the amount of consideration companies in Title II received in exchange for providing products or services. Consideration is either a promise of cash or actual cash. And then products or services, that can be anything. Whatever they have committed to give out, that is what the product and services is. And in accounting, we always like to give unique labels to things. So in accounting, products and services are often called a performance obligation. Let's remember this phrase, performance obligation. Performance obligation is a fancy way of saying, this is the same thing we sell. This is the product we provide. This is the service we provide. So if I go to 7.11 and I buy a Slurpee, the performance obligation is a Slurpee. So it's really not that hard. This is the product or thing that we sell. Now it gets a little harder because different companies have very unique products, and they're provided in different ways or different timelines. That's where things get more complicated. But when you hear me say performance obligation, and I'm going to say that a few times today, just think it's a product or service. It's a Slurpee. There's some synonyms. One of the challenges we have in accounting is there's one idea with five different ways to say it. So the idea of revenue, the five different ways to say it are sales, net sales, sales revenue, service revenue, even top line, all of those relate to revenue. I'm pretty much going to say sales or revenue, one of the two. One additional quick comment is on this one. These two are actually two different types of revenue. And some of you work at businesses that provide sales revenue. Some of you work at businesses that provide service revenue. And the accounting team at your business is will distinguish between the two. We don't just throw them into one big bucket. We'll actually say, okay, this is service revenue. This is sales revenue. We'll keep them in separate accounts. And it's going to be much more transparent throughout today's activities. Why would you? All right. So again, what is revenue recognition? It's a unique term to blend those together. What it is is all about timing and amount of revenue that gets recognized. It's the when and how much. And it sounds super simple. But anecdotally, there's lots of evidence that if fraud is to occur, it almost always happens in revenue because either the amount or the timing is manipulated by broadsters. So it sounds simple when and how much it should just be at the appropriate time, with the exact amount. Well, again, it's more complex than that. And we'll see some of that complexities that complexity has been forward. The core principle, I know there's a lot here. But the idea in terms of timing is when we transfer control. So let's go back to my 7-11 example. What's the timing of revenue recognition? It's when the customer takes the slurpee and walks away, you know, gets in there, many men to go and place the rest of the day. That is the transfer of control. We can check that box, right? The other phrase that's going to be used a lot is delivery. When I deliver the service, if I'm a lawyer and I deliver whatever the product is, that's delivery. If I'm a SaaS company over time, as I deliver those subscribed services, that's delivery. So delivery and transfer control are kind of synonyms here. In terms of measurement, the amount is basically the amount that you actually receive or your entitled to receive. Those are usually the same. It's just a timing difference. Sometimes you don't get cash, but you get a receivable or a promise of cash. That's fine. We can work in a program like that one. Now, one thing that is going to happen is we will often detach the recognizing of revenue from the cash flow. There are a number of instances where a company receives cash, but records revenue later. Or by source, a company records revenue and then receives cash later. That's actually important for us to realize that timing, we're actually going to not pay attention really to the cash flow. The cash flow is matter from a cash perspective, but from a revenue perspective, what we're going to try to do is look for an economic event that signals the transfer control and exchange of goods. That's what we're going to look for. Not cash flow. There's a five step process. This is in the book. Obviously, I post these slides and you've got it right there typed out for you on the handout. I won't just walk my way through these. Let me just point out a few key steps. Step one, identify contract. It doesn't have to be an actual written contract. If I go to 7-Eleven, I buy a Slurpee, there's no contract, right? Nobody's signing it. But there is an implicit contract. I give them $2, they give me a lemon-lime Slurpee, we're all happy. There is an implicit contract whether it's state-of-the-run. Step two, identify the performance obligation. What's the performance obligation in my 7-Eleven example? It's just a product or service. Now you'll notice that it has performance obligations, like the S is in parentheses. That's where things start to get hard. Oftentimes you are 7 more than one thing as a bundle. We'll talk about that in your data class. Determine the transaction price, that's almost always given. Then we allocate the transaction price. If there's a difficult step, it's the fourth. That's the hardest step. Again, in a simple case where I'm just buying and selling a Slurpee, you just allocate the transaction price to the Slurpee in your account. But oftentimes you have three or four performance obligations and they are delivered at different times. That's where things get difficult. We're going to walk through a full case example of that data class. Once you've done with the set one before, that's where we actually recognize revenue. You'll notice that it says, recognize revenue as or when the performance obligation is set. It's not when the cash loads. Notice there's a missing word up there. Cash. The cash is not the driver. Now if you're in a small business and you're running this, so I have a little consulting business with a couple of professors, everything is based on cash loss. It's just a small business. We actually all have PhDs in accounting. But we don't use gap. I know that might blow your minds. But you don't need to get small business. All we need is basically five tax returns. So we don't necessarily use gap. If you're in that small, it's just you and your best friend starting a business, you won't be moving into gap for a few years. Most of the places you're in turning out or on the internet, they're going to use the exact process. In other words, they're not going to tie the revenue recognition to cash loads. And this will be cashed out. All right, let's start with, we're going to do five cases today. And this is meant to be the easiest kind of base case. Nords from sales to suit. When should Nords from a recognized revenue on the sale of this suit? I'm looking for a word that begins with D and ends with delivery. So when should Nords from a recognized revenue on the suit? The delivery. Most of the time, I don't know if I don't give percentages. I don't know. But most of the transactions we do from a business to consumer basis are based on delivery. If you recognize revenue when the slurpee, suit, or shoes, whatever it is that you're buying is purchased most. Now there's going to be some places where that's violated. But if it's just a basic point of sale transaction, we report revenue upon delivery. Yes? So when somebody drops off a name on package at my house, I think that picture is that when they're reported? That's a great question. I actually want to throw that out. So let's add some, I want you and your group to talk through these additional settings. Suppose one of these six kicks in. How does that change when we report revenue? You got 97. So just speak on this if you want to get set. Go. Does it change? Does it change? It's the type of thing that you say on the market. But I think the line is really because I kind of already actually used this thing. So it's the opposite. I'm going to say that it's not the same. It's not the same. Because they don't think we're charging. It's the same way it should be. Yeah, I say it's not necessarily like a different thing. But it's basically the same. The gift for it does change. And even though someone pays more attention, you can't look at it. Even a person you don't know, it's a different thing. I say their life is the same. It's the same day. It's the same. It's the same. Yeah. I think I want to say this. It's the same. And then you have to make a difference. Yeah. Also, basically, it does change. But it does change. But actually, that one is again a little bit different. But I feel like I don't want to say it. And it almost happens at the same time. Which I feel like I don't want to say it. Because you don't want to say it. And yeah, very. Just feel. I would just be so happy to say it. Thanks for watching. That's what I actually felt. Thank you so much. It was your stoppage? I was like, I'm tired. I am tired. Netflix? You guys did Warpies and Spoon. I like Warpies. I was in Blooper. I didn't know how to use that. I was like, I'm going to bump you up. I was like, I'm going to bump you up. I'm going to make it a council. Well, pretty good. Before we even get started, we're going to keep, we're going to see right in the middle of the road. So each of these has a potential for a long tangential discussion. Lots of what ifs. We're going to try to avoid too many of those. We're going to stay right here in the center just to make sure we get core principles down. So I'm going to group the first three together. What if we pay with a Visa card, a Northland card, or a gift card? We're focusing on the revenue recognition. How does that change things? That doesn't mean that. For the first three, it does change the cash looks. For sure. But that's not the question we're asking. So with a gift card, we receive the cash win in advance. The Visa card, a Northland card, we receive the cash a little bit on a delay. But from a revenue recognition point, standpoint, it's at delivery. All right. What is the customer or is online? This is to your question. So thanks for letting me punch on that for a minute. What do we do there? What do you think? A punship. When it's shipped. It's either when it's shipped or when it delivers. If we're going to treat those as one and the same. I know that sounds a little bit slippery. But it's mostly because, usually what happens is when UPS takes control, there's a guarantee of delivery. So you're allowed to report it when UPS takes it. That's actually why they take the pictures because they're trying to satisfy that guarantee delivery. So depending on the contract, we're going to call both delivery. Whether it's, but it's out of that company's hands. So when an Amazon gives it to UPS, Amazon from an accounting standpoint, has satisfied their performance obligation. Okay. The same is true from Northroom. The same is true for most businesses. Yes. So for Amazon, they're more likely to be able to deliver it themselves. They're likely to report it at the majority versus if they have to go to the third party. It can go either way. But yes, I think that's a good general principle to operate with. And again, there's always exceptions. Our goal is not the exception. Our goal is that 80 to 90%. 90% of the time, that's exactly right. Okay. What about returns? So what do we know about Northstrom, right? What is one of those things that Northstrom is now for? Returning tires. Returning tires. Yes. So you heard that's anecdotally right? What's the anecdote, right? They return tires. Some lady want to return tires or bad. They're like, we don't sell tires. They'll wait too many ways or we'll regret it. Yeah. So that literally happened. Some lady returned tires. I just want to sell. I don't know if it was like, sure, we'll give you a refund. Right. Which is crazy, right? But that, they had generated so many sales. Right. That little amix, don't. You guys see that? Lots of us heard that. Like, great. I'll buy all my stuff. I'll just take the case. It takes the place away. So suppose they return it in seven days. How does that change the revenue recognition? What do you think? Well, I assume you still, you know, I mean, I can see in the future. I assume Northstrom can. So I assume they still recognize revenue up the day of delivery. But then you make an adjustment at the seven days afterwards. So trying to track the return that you had it returns an expenses account. Like you. Good. You could say that or something. Okay. Yes. That's exactly right. So you can't see it in the future. Right. So as of day zero, they're going to recognize the revenue. And then seven days they're going to make an adjustment when it comes back. Now, what actually happens in the meantime, and we won't go into this. We still have bandwidth. We'll estimate the amount of returns that they'll have. They'll say 10% of our sales are returned. And they'll create what's called an allowance account, which is a control revenue account. It's offsetting. So they know they're going to get returns. This is no surprise to anyone including a county team in Northstrom. So they estimate the amount of returns and they'll set up an offsetting against the other. So when you look at real income statements, you're going to see that it says sales revenue comma net. Remember I was talking a little bit about this. On day two, we talked very briefly about that. That's what they do. They're not going to report 100% of revenue because they're not going to, some of that's going to be returned. So the estimate, what portion might be returned, and then as those returns come in, then they true up that account. They connect the estimates to the actual realization. Okay. We're going to keep moving just, we've got so much to cover again. What about tailoring? This one is interesting. What did you guys think about or talk about tailoring? Is it two different instances of Bates? I can maybe think of some sort of something. You sell the students, so they deliver it and then you walk over to another one. Yes. We're going to call it two different performance applications. Okay. So remember we're talking about sales revenue and service revenue being two different concepts? Here we are. When they sell the suit, that's the sales revenue. When they provide the tailoring, that's service revenue. So the sales revenue itself would be reported at delivery. Of course, you can think about what the ifs and all the differences. But the main thing I want you to realize is this is an instance of two performance applications. One is the product they sell, one is the service they provide on that product. Two different service performance applications. And it's possible that those are the ones in the same terms of timing. It's possible that one is delayed, just depends on certain instances, which we don't need to tell you. Okay, a couple of quick questions in the video. I'm a fortune-lake includes tailoring sometimes. If it do is have one transaction, they would sell actually. So they probably line up the timing, but they still separate them in two buckets. Sales and service revenue. Yeah. Tell them to keep saying, get close. So line up the time, but I think you still want to save them out. Now how do you do that? Well, that gets hard, right? Because it's just a $500 suit. You have to figure out what portion of that's related to tailoring, what portion of that's related to the product itself. And that's where it's really hard. That's it. All right, we're going to keep moving. Just going to have to forgive me in advance. I'm going to listen to a lot of hands, but we've got a lot to cover today. Okay, let's talk through. We're going to go through four more cases. And each of these cases are not going to mirror each other. They're each different types of businesses that you might be involved with in your internships or jobs. And you have in the past, maybe in the future. But the goal is this, both you two will find your business models, all of which have different methods of revenue recognition. So here are the ideas we've got, delayed delivery, ongoing delivery, long term contracts, and then what we're going to call multiple out, which is just fondle sale. Okay? So the next one I'm going to turn to, and this is the order we'll go in. We'll talk about all five of these, well, all four of these going forward. So let's start with this next case. We're going to use this case based on a company called WAMO. Now I didn't make this company up. It's a real company. Has anyone potentially seen a WAMO product? What is it? Frisbee's. Frisbee's? What else? Is that what your boss? Oh, they got like, oh, what the bull thing. Okay, Frisbee's, Fung football balls. Pull toys, nerfs. Yeah, the thing that I saw in Costco just this summer was slipping flies. Okay, so let's get, yeah, slipping. It doesn't just make you happy just thinking about slipping. Sorry, I'm sorry. What do these all have a common liability? Okay. Yes, check. In addition to the liability, what else? What about in terms of the timing? These are seasonal, exactly. I don't want to slip and slide, at least not in Utah, in January. Is there a different kind of slip and slide in January? So these are seasonal sales. Very common is the company is to have seasonal sales. If you look at the sales revenues of Home Depot, for instance, their revenues in the summer months are double to triple what they are in the winter months. But they have unbelievable seasonality. So this is an instance where we have a company that their products, Frisbee's, and Nerf footballs, and slip and slides are things that we sell in the summer. Or that customers want to take delivery out in the summer. That's going to be important. Okay, so here's the case. In February, the company pays for a large order in inventory. They ask WAMO, like the Frisbee company, to slip inside companies, to hold off. Don't deliver until June. Lens you WAMO record revenue. Okay, what do you guys think? How many do you say June? February. How many do you didn't vote? All right, answer is June. Okay, so this, we haven't introduced the wrinkle yet. So your instincts were spot on. This is a case where we have to wait until delivery actually happens. Again, we will detach the cash flow. You know the cash flow happens in February. We will detach the cash flow from the revenue recognition, which will improve June. And that's going to be true for most instances like this. Except, and this is one of those exceptions I want to teach. There are instances where, yeah, generally it says in California, it's supposed to allow for the revenue recognition revenue upon signing of the contract. As long as the contract is written with certain features. That's what I want to talk about. Now the name of this is called a bill and hold arrangement. The idea is you bill and sign a contract in February. You hold the delivery until June. That's what mean my bill and hold. The cash flow, the bill and the contract is in one month, a few months later, you deliver the good. So here's what I want to do. Let's just have a class discussion. I want you and your group to come up with, if you were to write the contract that you think would be ideal here, then prevent the acceleration of revenue, but actually makes economic sense. What circumstances or conditions would you place on the contract to allow for revenue recognition in February? If you were writing gap, how would you write? You got 90 seconds to see if you could come up with some four points. Go. Okay. I can do this like, we're going to do this in a couple of minutes. Thank you. It's actually an offer to them. I do think one of them is like, I don't know if I can do it like this. I don't know if I can do it like this. I've got the one that's right. So I can bail, I'll do this one. You would have to do it like this. There's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's There's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's I fucking Ñ First of all, what kind of account is deferred revenue? You can remember? I have a revenue. Very good. A deferred revenue is a liability account. It represents my obligation to provide what? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The products are services. So it's a unique liability. Most liabilities like a loan. My obligation is to give them some cash. I satisfy the loan with cash. With a deferred revenue, the way I satisfy the loan, this obligation is by doing that thing that I do, providing my service, providing my goods to the customers. So you have a deferred revenue that arises when there's a timing difference between receiving cash and actually doing the work and recognizing revenue. In that time window, we have an obligation called deferred revenue. So that's what deferred revenue is. The deferred revenue by and large is a short term account. Because usually it doesn't take you years to satisfy us. Usually it takes you months. So it's less than within 12 months. So it's typically a short term obligation. And in the base case of Lambo, the one where we all decided that they should recognize revenue in June. What they would have between February and June is deferred revenue. OK? So that's kind of the base case. All right. Now what we're saying though is, if we have a bill and hold arrangement or bill and hold contract signed, we actually might not have to have a deferred revenue. So what are the conditions that you with your group came up? Let's see if we've just raised hands. Give me one of. There's actually I'm looking for four. See if you can give me one. Please. It's already produced and on the floor. Good. It's a finished good. It's not an idea. It's not a real tangible finished good. Good. What else? Please look at the set aside or designate it. Good. We need this to be roped off set aside, completely designated as being for a particular customer. Anything else? What do you think? Well, I said that you're going to sense renting your warehouse space as part of the package. Mm-hmm. In which case it's delivered to the customer. OK, good. Similar idea. Right? It's like this is their space. Yeah. Good. What else? We said some sort of like a pullout cloth kind of customer where they can decide essentially to return it into the lab and see. OK. I think that's hair. I think I would be a good partner if I could. Some sort of pullout or exit cloths, right? Yeah. Kind of the same thing we said. It's like kind of how they have something designated for returns that like for cancellations or for where their policy does have like a, OK, good amount set aside for the ownership. All right. Good. Anything else please ask? I think the situation might be dropped. Shifting or whether it's like a third party storage or something. I don't think you can like an authentic hair. Somebody who verifies, is that what you say? Yeah. Like a separate from one. Yeah. An independent contractor takes care of it. Let's even get one more. I actually have to like transfer the ownership to them. OK. Good. Good. OK. So here I'm going to give you the four. You guys are all around. You got all of these directly and indirectly. So these are the four that Gap has written. And frankly, I think if I were writing these, I would do four plus the ones you gave. So here are the four. First, there has to be a sustainable reason or substantive, I forgot that phrase. So a substantive reason, which is something that the customer requests is actually really important. It can't be the seller who's like trying to sell these things as a way to accelerate revenues. It has to be a reason provided for and requested by the customer. Second, you guys talk about this. The goods have to be severally identified as the customers. Third, the goods have to be completed. And fourth, the seller cannot use them. The goods separately for someone else. They have to be restricted. OK. So the second and the fourth are pretty closely linked. Now, in addition, if you wanted to add clauses about returns and independent verification, all of that is, I think, really smart contracting. These are the four that the gap requires. And all four must be met. If any one of these four fails, then the whole thing cancels as being, if it cannot be considered a villain, whole, and we go back to this base case where we had to defer revenues or come. OK. Now, suppose that they do meet all four conditions. OK. So when should they report revenue on this transaction? OK. How many say February? June. How many didn't vote? OK. Is that can I not agree with you? So it's a unique case. And what I wanted to show you is that gap is actually fairly adaptable to business circumstances, including seasonality. It's not perfect by any means. But it realizes there's different business models. And it says, OK. Look, if you're like WAML and you have seasonality, we're not going to punish you before you have positive regret in it. But we are going to make you meet some pretty strong conditions. Meet those? OK. I can't do it. All right. I do one question. I'm going to keep it. So what is the system where the data is seen the order to use our compared to the local holds of the current type that is going to stay in April or April? It's at contract. So it has to be all met at contract. So again, this gradual rollout of the condition of the later met has to happen at contract. But bigger picture is this. Gap is a minimal to different business conditions and operating models. My business operations are seasonal. There are considerations in gap that allow for that. And then do it again. So it's not as stringent as it should be when you see it. OK. Let's go to the third case. We're going to look at a real company called Second Life. And you can probably guess what kind of company this is. So this is a company in which you can have basically you log in. It's a whole different virtual world. There's literally millions of users. This is a billion dollar company. In this life, I have an avatar that's 6 foot 7 and you've got the basketball. They're never ready for two in my life. And you can imagine this is like, but this is a real business. A little bit of details. Second life users deposit non-refundable cash into this economy for lending dollars, right? So they have their own virtual currency. The exchange rate is about, there's natural exchange rate. May that, that's interesting. And it fluctuates right between $215, $300 to $200. The economy in this second life has a GDP of 650 million. There are multiple countries that don't have that big of an economy. So it's pretty amazing, right? This is a real thing and has a lot of users. It's on you. OK? So let's see if we can hear our head around revenue recognition for a business model like this. So suppose users of second life pay $20 to create their avatar and participate in this world for 12 months. Payment is required at the start of the term and is non-refundable. You've got one minute with your team. You've got to decide when the revenue should be recognized. So in your mark, you said go. Landscape from the digital economy. Have you seen how much confidence has今回? Becausestroke is difficult. Equal rights are slower than time. My guess on this is by keeping a Check ret pigeon cash. All right. Let's talk through this. Okay, so, uh, let's create, we're going to have to plan like we have three options. You tell me what three that you might consider. So what was one potential option for when to record this revenue? Down? You can put it in for a moment as this is right here. Okay, perfect. So let's say spread out and for lack of a better word, one option is to spread out over time. What's another option? The beginning, please. Right at the beginning. Okay, with the rationale on that one typically is that we receive payment, it's not a funnel. Okay? One other one. What's one other possible option? At the end. And the idea is that we got to wait till the end when that performance obligation is satisfied. Okay, so everyone has to vote. There's no down vote. Okay? So three options. I'll go in order that you gave them to me. How many say spread out over time? How many say at the beginning? How many say at the end? How many if you didn't vote? We'll count. Okay, we got a whole vote. So you said spread out over time. The answer is spread out over time. That might have helped that we've got 120, which divide by 12 pretty easily. A little hint, if you ever see a word problem with two numbers, usually you're going to add subtract multiply or divide. I'd literally teach my kids this. Straight to two numbers, put something between it and see what makes sense. So here we just 120 divided by 12. That kind of makes sense. That's not an accident that is divided perfectly over the time. So here's the idea. What's the performance obligation for this company? Access to the game. Yeah. It's access. Yeah, that's a great word for it. They have to provide access to the game. And that's not a one time thing. It's an ongoing thing. So we actually call this ongoing delivery. That's what I've labeled it in your handout. This is ongoing access. We're providing this performance obligation literally 24-7. Okay. Now, of course things happen, servers break down. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't sweat about all those exceptions. But this is ongoing delivery. And we're going to spread out that revenue recognition over time. So what we would do is record it radically. That's the actual work from Gap. We heard the word pro-rate. We're just pro-rating the revenue over time. And there's multiple ways to do that. But let's just say it's monthly. Okay, just a few bits simple. So again, different business model. Gap is amenable to it. You just have to ask yourself, what is the performance obligation and when is it being delivered? In this case, performance obligation is in fact access. And it's being delivered continuously. Not just briefly. It's not a one time thing. It's not a Slurpee, right? Which is just a one time thing, unfortunately. Mine is a continuous Slurpee. I actually never thought of that before. Okay. It's a one time thing, or sorry, it's a continuous thing, right? Spread out over the entire year. So we'll recognize the revenue. Nice session. All right, let me talk about the things. Suppose that I want to go to the digital prompt. Okay? And so I go to the digital morstrum, which has a different name, because it's in the second line. So I go to the digital morstrum. I want to buy a digital suit to take my digital girlfriend to the digital prompt. Okay? It's $10 to buy this digital suit. US, but with your group, convert it into lindons, but just let's stick with 10 US. With your group, decide, when do I recognize the revenue on the suit? You got 66 seconds. Go. No, no, they'll be here. Because it's getting like, oh, it's not here. Yeah. It's a problem. It's a problem. It's a problem. Yeah. You know, you have to look at the digital. You got it. That's your secret route. And then, all I have is, I can be absolutely thrilled with this. I feel like, you know, the light is falling. You know, it's going to be really bad. It's a matter of all things. It's a matter of all things. You know, I think it's a matter of all things. So, you know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. You know, it's a matter of all things. At the moment, it's a matter of all things. That's what we're saying. It's an option. It's an option. It's an option to deliver this to us. So one option is delivery, right? So when that avatar takes the suit and puts it on, okay, option A, celebrate. Option B. When they convert their regular dollars to read to... Okay, upon digital conversion or on the currency exchange, is that what we're talking about? Okay. Option B, currency exchange. What are some other ones? Any other ones? What's the problem? Happens. Yeah, upon the digital prom. Just give me one. Anything else coming to mind? It's a party in the moment and then, along to the times of this discussion. So spreading it out. Yeah, it's spreading out. So option four is spreading it out. Okay, I'm going to get to remember all those. I can't even remember when I'm taking kids to soccer. So let's start with the first one, delivery. How many vote delivery? How many votes the exchange from currency? How many votes did you do to prom? Good day. Celebrate that digital prom. How many votes over time? Answer over time. Wow! Okay, here it goes. There you go. There you go. Okay, good boy. So, for better or worse, our family is a Fortnite family. Okay, so how many of you played Fortnite in a little bit? I stink at it. Yeah. My main job to Fortnite is to bring my kids to the Scots down. Right? There was a few years ago where I decided that I wanted my basement to be a sports bar so I went to Costco and I bought four TVs. I bought four Xboxes and we set it all up and it's awesome. And so we as a family will sit down and play. Now, we don't play it. They haven't played in like a year and a half because it's one of these things that they come in to and go out of. And it's more of a winter kind of thing. So it's literally been many, many months. But what can you buy in Fortnite? Those are the most beautiful skins. Deemotes. Deemotes. Deemotes. Music and demotes. Right? Emotes are what? Emotes are dance moves. Right? So like, buy the Grady. Yeah. Okay. What is the performance obligation for the digital Grady forever? It's forever. This is an ongoing, it's access to use this word. My kids come in and out of Fortnite. Right? They literally will go months and months eating years where they don't play it. Then they get back on, they log into their account and throw me a remember their password. And they go, oh, sweet. I love this digital Grady where I love this skin or this other whatever sword that they have. My rule is I buy none of that. I have literally the most rookie new, uh, we call D-Fone PC. Yeah. Or you are the D-Fone. That's my hair. Yeah, that's my hair. I don't know because I refuse to spend money on it. But I'm also, my kids spend so much money on a terrible hair. Don't move along, I'm not paying you for it. They move along and they spend money on digital skin. Okay. Coming back to the full idea of those, we have to ask ourselves economically, what's the performance obligation? It's not a suit. It's just some code, right? It's just literally some code. They're not buying the code. They're buying access to use that whenever they want. So what you have to do is figure out how do we approximate when they're going to use it? And that gets harder. And typically what companies do is they figure out a subscription term or an average life, right? So how long do our customers typically have the app? How long do our customers typically keep a subscription? And they'll spread it out over time. So this is a subscription kind of business. You all have subscriptions in your life from Netflix to car washes to gym memberships. All of this, these kinds of services require continuous delivery. Right? And if that's the case, you have to spread out the revenue recognition over some approximation. Now what this also tells you is that there's some loosey-pussiness here. Right? Because what exactly is the average life of a second-life user? And what if they have a 12-month subscription but they buy it in the last month? Right? There's a lot of different what-ifs and potential ideas that again, we'll kind of stay away from. The bigger picture that you realize, what's the performance obligation? It's access. We have to figure out a way then to spread the revenue recognition over the time when that performance obligation is being satisfied. Okay? That's the big picture. And companies that you know of, right? You have a paper subscription monthly or annual, they're doing this. So what happens though? So suppose it's Netflix. You all may have a seven-netflix or you share Netflix. What Netflix does when they get cash in, it's the one to be an effort revenue for that month. It's not only here but it's more that month. It's going to be the first revenue for that small window when you're satisfying with the performance obligation. They don't need to record it immediately. Okay? So the first revenue is a really important concept and a really important term to know when you're understanding revenue recognition. If there's a delay between the cash flow and the revenue recognition, you have the first revenue in that time window. All right, lines are a couple of questions and we'll be going. Alex. So mine, right, is going to be an increase. Great. In some cases, there's a standard value. So that provides that. So you know what I'm saying about a lot of people, but how do they value that? So they'll have what's called a reserve or some kind of one-drop of the reserve for offset back. So that's going to happen for all these kinds of businesses. Carwash, it's shut down for a day. Right, it's happening. So they'll have some sort of reserve. They don't always give you that money back. Right, not every company gets, but those who do will have some way to offset and reduce the revenue in that regard. Please. So obviously we talked about the second idea to pay to play and then you can pay for a suit or whatever. Is it different with something like Fortnite where it's free to play and then you would purchase the skin? Or are we still just basing it off of the average lifespan? What you would end up doing there, because there's not a subscription period, you just say what's the typical user's interaction. Right, there's so many games like that. Right, download Candy Crush, it's free. So you end up paying $200 by, you know, like, verbal diamonds. Right, that is like a business model. I'm sure some of you engage with that either as consumers or as workers. And it's totally fine if you don't buy a initial product. It's the secondary product that we're actually talking about. And it is, it is a continuous delivery. So you have to spread that out over time. Good. Okay, let's keep going. So now let's talk about another case, long-term contracts. These are instances where something takes a long time to produce. So imagine if you are on the construction company that is building the solid temple. Right, we're building solid. That's a many, many probably $100 million project. Supposed to take four years to have taking seven, this is normal. Maybe all men, this is normal. We built a house supposed to take six months to 13 months. Right, it just stuff happens. When you have these long-term contracts, how do you recognize revenue? Or the other way to say it is when is the performance obligation satisfied? Now I used to have a big case on this. It just gets a little bumpy. So I mostly have to understand and do it here. Do we wait to recognize revenue until the 70 year when the temple is finished? No. That's just too conservative. We're not going to force that. That's just brutal. What about when the cash is received? Here again, I'm going to say no. It's either too aggressive or what I'll say is too lumpy. A lot of times these cash flows come in really in chunks. You'll get nothing and then you'll get a 20% payment. You'll get nothing. You'll get another 50%. So we can't tie it to the cash. So what we're going to end up doing is we're going to use the methods most common is what's called percent of completion. So the idea is if I have an MBA student a few years ago who worked on the Mars rover, these things would take like six years to build this giant machine that could actually walk on Mars. And what they would do is they would say, okay, it takes six years to build this. We're going to recognize revenue based on our estimate of how complete the project is. So how do you measure completion? Well, you basically take the ratio, so this is a real company for a great job. I believe they actually recruit here. I can't remember. Is anyone seeing them here? Did a defense contractor locate any Tucson? This is from their 10K. What it says is we recognize revenue based on the extent of progress towards completion. So if they're 20% done, they get a report 20% revenue. So how do you get to 20%. Will you take the ratio of the costs incurred to date over the total estimated costs? So it's based on costs. So if I've incurred $30 million in cost to date and I'm estimating $100 million total cost in 30% of your second date. 30% estimate their total cost to date over 30 million of costs in her today or over 100 million estimated total costs. Now, the beauty of this is it's fine if things go awry because they always do, right? We're always over budget. We're always taking too long. Because if you look at the metric here, it's costing her today. We know what that is in the newer air. If you did an omni-er, it's an estimated total cost. Well, if that goes up, then your percent of completion goes down. And the math actually works out pretty well. So, these I used to make you go through that math, you won't go through that. All I'm going to know now is there's a very simple way for us to estimate percent of completion on these long-term projects that take two or five years. And it's just actual costs over total estimated costs. And that's the percent complete and you recognize revenue as you move forward. All right, last one. Both but elements. This one is a museum. Okay? When I say multiple elements, what I actually mean is that these are sold in a bundle. Okay? To illustrate this point, let's actually talk about a phone. So, actually, I've had, I literally had the first iPhone way back when. It was like one fourth the size of this monstrosity. And that's what we're today. I've got whatever the 16 and I don't know what it is. When I buy an iPhone, and for me it's just my phone. For Apple, it's more than a phone. One phone is actually in their minds three performance obligations. Isn't that interesting? It's not just a phone. There's actually three things that they are obligated to provide to users. The first is the hardware, right? It's the actual physical phone. The second is all of these software, it's like iCloud, Serian Maps. And then the third is the underlying iOS, right? Unspecified software upgrades. Three different performance obligations. Now what makes this hard is the timing. If I had three performance obligations, when do you think I record the revenue on the phone itself? It's exactly like that. And delivery. When do I record the revenue on iCloud? What does that feel like? It feels like overtime right? Continues delivery. Same with software. So, what ends up happening is you have to detach these three from each other and record revenue. So, one phone is three different instances of recording revenue. And then they sell 100 million phones a year. So, it's this unbelievable task to track all of that separately. They can do it. Obviously they've got amazing systems to deal with that. But we're going to work through this process fairly quickly. And we're going to use an iPhone as an example. The numbers are terrible, but they're meant to keep it simple. So, obviously the numbers don't match reality. But I do that because they're divisible. We want it to evenly visit the numbers. So, this company sells a phone. It's $10 for the phone. If you'll sign into your contract in $40 a month. If you're going to buy the phone separately, it's $100. And they sell that contract that... Sorry, the phone costs wireless $100. And they sell it separately for $120. So, we're going to work through this five step process. The first is their contract. Yeah, it's a contract. The customer agrees to pay $9.70. Now, this is important. Where did I get that number? $9.70. It's all of the things that are embedded in the price, including 24 months. So, we're going to look out in the future and say, this is what the ultimate price will be. Even if some of that cash flow won't occur for many months. So, $9.70 is going to be a total price, which is just $10 for that initial fee, and then another 24 months at $40 a month. Okay? What is the performance allocation? Well, it turns out there's two in this instance performance allocation, just to keep our lives easy. There's a phone. It's $120. And then there's service. And that service is $960. Now, what you can see, what makes this hardest, at least from the county standpoint, is that the phone... They're not paying us $120 for the phone. They're paying us only $10. But we've got to figure out how to separate revenue, because we're going to allocate revenue separately to each of these two performance obligations. So, what's the transaction price? Well, actually, RDA2, it's $9.70. Okay? And then the hard part is step four. As I mentioned, the hard part is, oh, in this, in all these kinds of problems with step four. So, for step four, we have to figure out how to allocate this. Now, this might... It seems really hard, but all I want you to do is kind of create a design where you just figure out what's the proportional value of each item in the package. If I have a pie chart, what's the value? And a pie chart always adds up to 100%. What's the pie for the phone? And what's the pie for the service? And what you can see is, if I just take the total value, if I were to buy the phone, it's $120. The service is $960. In total, that's $1080. So, proportionally, that means the phone is 11% of the total pie. And the service is 89% of the total pie. And those numbers are going to matter. This is the hardest part. But it's just take the pie, figure out each slice of pie, how much belongs to the phone, how much belongs to the service, to 11% and 89%. You're stockably. Okay? And then, I just apply it. I've got $970 and 11%. $970 at 89%. That means I will recognize 108 dollars of revenue on the phone. And $862 of revenue on the service. And we're almost done, but we're not done just yet. Okay? And the reason we're not done yet is because these two performance obligations are satisfied at different times. When do we satisfy the performance obligation for the phone? Delivery. When do we satisfy the performance obligation for the service? Radically. Beautiful. Right? Over the 24 months. So, we've got to figure out that math. Okay? So, what we're going to end up doing is, we're going to, I've got a, I'll put it about that in a minute. We're going to basically record this amount of revenue, 108, when we deliver the phone, and then we're going to radically split that out. Dad is called, the deferred revenue group. So, this is going to be deferred revenue that they give us, that is going to be spread out, radically or monthly, ever-time. Okay? All right. Last but not least, it's just a little peptide awards, okay? You are now a month in your MBA program, right? Who does to you? Yeah, that's amazing, amazing accomplishment. You only have 23 months to go. You know, you know, you don't have to do that. So, I want to share just a quick point. You know, you're about to take an exam or an experience in my class. Anyone remember this movie? What's this movie? League of the R. League of the R. So, the premise of this movie, you can see this is Tom Hanks, the middle, I forget the other two after his name. But, the premise of the movie is, during World War II, all the baseball leagues shut down, because, you know, a lot of the men were off in the war. And so, a female even, right? There's a bunch of players, and they have a whole fan base, and they have some players. And this is the star player in the whole league. And she gets a ton of hate, because people are like, you know, a woman should be playing baseball, and so on and so on and so forth, right? She just said, I'm exhausted, I want to quit. And Tom Hanks has this great, let's see if we need to get to work. Has this great line, he's trying to, she's saying, I'm quitting, I'm doing a house. You try to talk her out, quitting. I can do what he says. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Apparently I don't know how to use it. So, again, he says, he says, it's tough, she says, it's really hard, I want to quit. He says, it's supposed to be hard. There wasn't hard, everybody would do it. The hard is what makes it great. And so, that's my little pep talk for you. If it was easy, everyone would have an NBA. Right? The point of an NBA eats that it's hard. That's precisely what makes it a signal of your quality of your talent and your learning. So, the hard is what makes it great. And I wish you the best of it. Good luck."
