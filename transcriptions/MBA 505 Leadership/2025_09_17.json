  "text": "So empathy, they talk about three primary types of empathy. So empathy is understanding the emotions of others. And so there's cognitive empathy, which is just knowing. So that's where we're knowing the emotions that other people are experiencing. Then there's emotional empathy, which is feeling the same feelings as someone else. So being able to actually feel those emotions with them. And then compassionate empathy is knowing what someone else is feeling and being moved to hell. So actually engaging in behaviors because you recognize those feelings. So oftentimes, you know, we focus on that emotion empathy, which can have actually some negative effect with the only focus on emotional empathy. We're focusing on compassionate empathy and actually being moved to hell, but maybe not feeling it as deeply can be a lot more effective, especially as a leader. And it can be somewhat negative to feel all, especially the negative feelings of people are feeling. And that can make you down. So being able to look at it from a different frame and decide how you're going to act can be very beneficial to you as well as the other people that are experiencing a lot of the same feelings. The other thing you often think about empathy in terms of negative emotions, but you can also have empathy for positive emotions too. And so particularly as a leader, like celebrating with your people feeling those positive emotions when they succeeded, that can help increase not only your capacity, but their capacity as well. So it can be both spectrum, both sides of the spectrum, in my. All right, so what did the data say about empathy? So they focused primarily on cognitive and emotional empathy and found that both positive relates to personal accomplishment. So when you personally are able to empathize with other people, you feel more accomplished at work. So whether you can know what they're feeling or feel what they're feeling, you feel more accomplished largely because of that connection, right? empathy, you feel that connection. And also when you feel more empathy, you have less depersonalization. So more empathy negatively relates to not caring about your work. So negative, negative, right? It makes it positive. So less depersonalization. So the more that you can empathize, the more that you can relate with people. They've done a lot of studies looking at empathy and healthcare providers, because healthcare providers experience a lot of burnout, a lot of depersonalization. They stop seeing patients as people and just see them as things to be treated. So what they find is that when you can engage in empathy, you're more likely to see patients as people and treat them better. So it can be an alliance to leaders as well. When you can see the people you're leading as people experience their emotions, see their emotions, you're more likely to see them as people to be led rather than, you know, cause in your machine. Questions? Oh, I'll just, okay, I think I just did the double negative. I think that's really interesting. I just wanted to just backtrack just quickly to the positive emotional and passion. So I totally understand like emotional feeling what's in our skills, passion, feeling with the health. It's only the more just like, like being able to understand like what do I get like in that situation? Like, oh, I get it would be so hard that you only got 50% on your phone. It's being able to identify the emotion that they're experiencing. So being able to tell are they frustrated or are they sad? Like what does that emotion that they're experiencing? It's really being able to pick up on this key to the point. It's so happy experience. Well, after that, like, I didn't find, I used to think that I'm like, okay, my IQ might be here, so I'm like, EQ might be a little bit harder than that, and then I was very proud of that. But recently my wife had pointed out one good thing to be married is you always have a second person there for you. That sometimes we would have interaction with people and she's like, you know, you might miss that or you might miss that. And then come with this reading and learning about empathy and I was like, okay, sometimes I don't identify that. I don't identify certain feelings or I feel like that is kind of like innated ability. Some people, people who are crispy might be very nature, very empathetic, and they're very good at sharing that. How do I develop that kind of skills to be more like, crispy like? Yeah, I'm just thinking about it. So it starts with asking questions, right? So recognizing when people are experiencing emotions and being like telling more, like telling more of what you're experiencing right now. And then that helps you gather information and like feel about your mental model of like these behaviors typically relate to this emotion, at least for this person if you can try and generalize. So just asking more questions and be curious. I thought Alex and Hansen will come up here. I just want to say, it's kind of like we were talking about active listening. You're like, listening and understanding what they're saying, but also there's the emotional aspect. How are they seeing that and then the culture of the person that is keeping up on it? How are they seeing that? Exactly. Great application. And again, kind of going back to the next question is, when you're actively listening and you can see that there are emotions there asking questions like, is this what you're experiencing? It seems like it might be this and they can correct you and that'll help you build that. That's really, you know, to say that sometimes when people are just like, sharing that experience, you know, like, yeah, I know what you're feeling. But indeed, saying that sometimes you don't have to have that to be bold, then you don't have to be the same experience. How do you different difference that from the government in front of you? You know, we definitely know that. Yeah, because you're right. You might go through the same experience and have different emotional reactions to it. So I think it goes back to asking questions. Are you feeling this way in just trying to get more information? Well, I feel like if I have a job that's really stressful and like I don't work to do, I just want to go to work at God's can. I don't really want to spend time worrying. It's actually like, if I'm like, solid operation that work in this function, like there's like social party, whatever. I think it's very sometimes like, I don't really want to go do that. Like, it's a way to tie. I can do my work. It's not going socializing. I try to play politics politics. But I just as important to that for me, I feel like people like me, I had to try very hard constantly to put like, oh, you do so great. Yeah, oh, that's a kid together. I think it's very difficult. I feel like, how, I don't know. I think I can force myself to do it. Today, the other suggestion to you. I mean, I know that's very important in corporate America. You probably have authentic. So I think that's the important thing. If you don't actually want to celebrate, like, if I'd be worse than to pretend to do it, then to not do it. So you want to be authentic. And I think it will push many of us to demonstrate empathy and just like, acting listening, there's a time and a place. So it's not like you have to be empathetic all the time. Just recognize that there are times when people are going to come to you and need that empathy and be willing to identify, oh, this is a skill like you, I'm just trying to be empathetic. But you do want to be authentic to me. I think there's other ways to be empathetic other than just like verbal affirmations. I like coming from an Asian household that's like kind of like an inside joke between Asian community that like parents, your parents will never like tell you that they love you, but then they'll like show up to your bedroom while you're studying and like bring you cut fruit and just like leave it there and leave. So like there's other ways I think to show that like you understand what they're going through because I'm not a very like verbal affirmation type person, which like is something I personally have to work on in my marriage because my husband is from the US and like is very used to that kind of validation. Sorry, I want to take all what she said. I feel like it's very true even though Asian don't really speak up a lot like my wife like always asking why don't you say love me more. I think you always look at more conversation. I feel like actions show more than wars but I guess everyone's different. So you had to like speak their life in the way. Yeah, and I think that's a great insight like everything doesn't have to be worse. It can be more than just words. It can be actions other ways that you can show empathy and that you understand other. So great, great. Thank you. All right, Alex and then we're going to remind you. I think there's a really interesting example of this in the book. She had one of her really close friends and met a person in public and last got her baby, spring to her baby, sport or baby and then was feeling all the guilt and shame that came with that right. And I like that she pointed out you don't have to done exactly what someone did for experience exactly what someone did but you can still find empathy for them. So like she she realized the moments like they she just feels like a bad mom right now. I felt plenty of times like a bad mom. I can actually relate you know I've never maybe done exactly she did. I've done other things that I felt I was doing for the I think it's the understanding. Like what they're saying not what they're saying right like what are they feeling it's not always in the words and you know I think it's it can be super powerful to just be like say like I'm here I'm here to talk. Yeah just someone to listen right and we learn on Monday that you really are. Okay. Radio is great in point insights and input about empathy and what it would like and how it can be effective. Let's go ahead and jump into our case discussion. Yeah. All right. So tell us about Microsoft and the house under power. It's bad. Super competitive even like with other industry leaders like it later it talks about like some lawsuits against people but this word we have to worry. There's no camaraderie everyone with old information in order to like put themselves ahead somebody else behind. So helping Jari and this moment of the reward system and how people were promoted was which was based on performance in my color Tuesday. So. The situation of the whole info. The other. It sounds like a terrible. Very competitive for sure. Yeah. I think they weren't like very innovative they were really focused on windows and so they missed out on a lot of things that they like had internally already. Done but they like didn't want to move forward with it because it wasn't online because they wanted. Okay. So not innovative focusing on exploiting windows. Very much. When you were. I guess by companies they were thinking just like for them instead of. Yeah. So we have great talent and. I'm kind of combined with the line of innovation. Each team was validate where. Okay. Okay. So we have these stack brain games. Stars that want to work together. What happens when you have stars not wanting to work together. What's the outcome of that? Innovation. Yeah. Less innovation. Your idea is caring and then. I also talk about that. The third of that is hostility and also like combined with that. acking cried. McKenzie. I think I mean this might just like from Problems and the same saying over but. I think the decision making process really long just saying because. They there were some invitations they want like I think there's like, yeah, let's do a phone and then the decision-maker is like, no, stupid. So all of their decisions were shot down, or all of the innovation was shot down. Shooting down, innovation. You said I'll add on to that. But what we do is, caddy on a super political and in one of the working followers, they sort of, it wasn't explained to the public audience, it was more kind of like, I want to take this thing and I guess, great. It's very nice going for a team innovation. It's not anyone else that's even. Okay, so it was a bit more focused. We're talking about hostility, but like, specifically teams, like, we're complaining about other teams, they go out to corporate treats, and they spend the whole time with saying, how bad, what else was their job? Okay, so we create team, hostility. Great, right? Building on that, I really like the term that you're looking at. Hey, hey. Teamhood actively prevent other teams from working on projects, projects. Had anyone heard that phrase before? No. A little bit of spud. I thought it pissed. Yeah. That's what we get to do. That's what we get to do. Okay, do you want to share? Like an actual cookie? Oh yeah. I don't know, I did not prevent other teams from selling projects. And there's a topic that should cookie, and I don't want you in now, but like, I don't want my brothers in here. Yeah, it's not. So it's not like that idea, right? Like, we've experienced that, for sure. All right. Again. Yeah, I feel like, so over here it says like, the only way to get rich is get promotion. And the only way to get promoted is to be who likes some people, like, right now, is getting like, the innovative. But it says over here, it says like, it has like a, every six months, it would happen like a sequester, law, horse trade, and ranking, some kind of thing. I don't really get it. Why did we do that? That's not that much. That's kind of like the policy that we're on a time, which is really, really like what I'm going to do. Yeah. Let's take a minute and try and understand why wood, bomber, why would they have this system of wood? What were they trying to do? I feel like, to an extent, they were attempting to promote hard work and innovation. They're trying to get people to work their way up. But at the same time, they incentivized pushing out people down because instead of just being the best, it became a who doesn't get you in private barriers, a person who's the second stylist, because it's the slowest person to be seen. And so it became best work of the thing. And I even experienced this, this is a fit of a Amazon because I have a very similar structure of the business. It's not as a part of the forest, especially the smaller teams, but they still have a stack range system within larger groups of managers. And if you're like the upper managers, as I was always saying, over and out is worried with necessarily what you and your individual self did with the younger individual team, but how did you help benefit the whole company as a whole? And it's like that's a trying to, like, it's about your larger impact, not just your small scale of individual impact, but people oftentimes wouldn't take that into account. So no matter how much leadership said it, people would then really feel it, except that they would continue to, those in Azure Streams trying to push this down as much, but it was very much like they mainly focused with their team. They weren't sharing their ideas under success. So treating that competition, which fits with values of the organization and competition about focus, it just had some negative outcomes as well. Sherry. I think they were focusing on the wrong things. For example, like we focused on windows. Like what works for windows? Not necessarily what works for the consumers. So like when some technology, new technology comes up that would be more user friendly, would be through user experience, they would shut it down because they don't think that it's important. Yeah. Just milk that cash cow as long as you can, right? Focus on the list. I hardly doubt that Bomber was not as long as, right? But I think he was playing a much loose game. Because windows is like one of the main corporations at the time, their base was in reaches and in the life. And the Obama-Kamizini, perhaps, I can't screw this up. So they're going to play defensive game. There's too much. So we're going to build up this structure in other much loose. We set up going forward. Right. And I think that's a really great point. He's definitely playing a defensive game, right? Keep things going in the way that they are. Don't lose this success. Much about like dolphins. History-wise, Steve Bomber had been there since basically the beginning as well. So he didn't just come in at 2000 to see you. He had been there since the beginning and seen this product completely from nowhere. So yeah, I'd buy a very much of your product. He's been alive and right that way. And so you know, you die, I think. And on this point, who is still there at this point? Bill Gates. Bill Gates, right? So even though Bomber and CEO Gates was still, I think, determined on the board. Like, he's still very involved. Paul Allen, all the original guys too. I guess in terms of Steve Bomber, we do have a minute and a half. You know, might not be the smartest leader. He never had a bus gate where he had my DNA per fraud. But we also, a big participant is there. He's stuck in set of structure, right? When you have this issue of a company that goes in public and you offer stock prices in a way that the meaning of all these employees that are new and watch the innovative, that kind of thing. And then typically, if your goal is to retain those employees, then you're going to keep people who are milking this, in essence, the options that they're having. And so then you bring on new employees out of this previous premise of, hey, you're going to have the same stock structure, but they don't see you the same cream of the crop. So it's because, now, the stocks are getting up down the border and you offer. Exactly. So the incentives all change. Great insights. Let's move on and talk about the dollar. So I'm going to come to Jayce. So what did the dollar do well as he came in? You really put a focus on elaborating and trying to cut it tear down the competition aspect and make sure that the people are collaborating together. And how did he do that? I think how I like to be mentioned for the previous table. He brought together, there were treats and changed it from kind of big ring and kind of complaining about everybody else. It's really focused on everybody seeing a vision of how we can change things and kind of shift the focus on the mindset that we're going forward. How do we change the mindset? I feel like he is a must-wear, deliberate, and kind of showing his authentic self-he showed how his personal history with his son and how he kind of developed his mindset over time. Like, I don't know if it was at the retreat or if he kind of did it at one of these initial leadership meetings where he kind of showed like I grew up playing cricket, these are things that I focused on with. Like, cricket, I was not always empathetic, I had a son and struggled with that for years and developed my empathy over that. And I think he also just shared a lot of responsibility and took ownership of things like what he messed up and had errors come up for different things. Like, when he said that I'm just snappled with how to help women get equal pay in the workplace, he didn't try to be rational and to be a rudder minimize it. He said, no, I'm as tough, I just said the wrong thing. I should have focused on how we can take more action rather than being passive. Okay, so modeling what he wanted people to do, showing what a movement like. Yeah, he laid a bunch of your wall. He did. And I like to his quote about how empathy doesn't take away your need or making hard calls to carry out those things with them. Okay, so empathy, and I'm going to say with accountability, we put it into the price under the leader wall accountability and part of that. So having that balance between those two. He, for us, as a leader too, gathered a lot of view back from leaders in companies kind of boiled down with the existential needs of the company where, and gathered away to say the company vision to be able to include those. So listening to people gathering feedback, and I'd read more about that. So just one of the first things that he did was he tried to like his, the rest of his leadership team to like view on the same pages and then he had to read a book and had like psychological coaches and people come in and like try to teach them and how to think differently. Okay, so it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him coaching, trying to take them on a journey as well. I really like how we focus on growth and vision, I would just pure revenue. It talks about how we wanted like one Microsoft that it might just fuels us and what everybody is. So any other? So if you're heard of the silos, so end the silos. Throw together. So it says, fish sticks, a renewing our company culture would be the highest priority for me. And then also he changed a lot of strategy. So instead like put Microsoft for the window system, like at a priority, agent strategy, like mobile version, also like offer. So he knows what's right now and what they need to work on this, they'll just cover another path. Yeah. What do you guys think about the congruence model in HRGN? Yeah. They've had all fits together, changing strategy, culture, structure, right, trying to change that all. You can write poetry anyways. Such was a binocaine sample. He does acquire a binocaine-spillated mobile business and business, but he ate the awesome learnings off of it. Okay. So focus on learning. Put that up here under culture. Can I make a nod to that? There's going to be a lot of work. I don't know how to do this strategy. He gave them a game to win, instead of like keeping the playing of dogs in the room and then putting them in the game and then the mobile first. And that they can be up to. That's a part of the culture. Okay. So playing an offensive game, instead of changing that, that mindset. That he has a change strategy, but really basically, he's still a professional focus. And then after the game, he's still a different person. He created a lot of good data and could do a practice job. I think it was a lot more early than it was. But he can help benefit from working together, except he's a professional focus. Yeah. So going back to the main point that we started with, the baller was focused on competition competition with other organizations competition within the organization. And then we see with the baller, more focused on collaboration, both within and outside. It's really focusing there. This definitely backs the active listening. He didn't just gather feedback, but he also like implemented the feedback and empowered people on his team to pursue other ideas. Okay. Implementing. What do you heard? She? Oh, I'm shifted from a know-it-all to learn it all. Oh yeah. Okay. So learn it all. So rewarding learning instead of just knowing? And what did you have to be the 16th, other all-in-migas-off? Yes, it's know-it-all. No, right? You had to prove that you were the smartest one on your team. So yeah, I did. Another matter I really liked that that was done was that they tried to get like full-pacinho and like everyone in the world did an Microsoft? Like out of Microsoft, so it was a world in C actually how their products were used. I think that was a cool way to connect like the word that everyone was doing. Like an impact they're having. Like it's like hard to see the impact of software. So you were working a lot with, but to be able to get out and actually like see a hospital and using Microsoft to like solve these problems, like to put away everyone aligned on it, the purpose of the organization from this time trying to win it. I don't know if it's good. Okay, so see what customers are actually using our products for. And what that looks like with the kids. I think it's interesting to how he was previously the leader of the cloud business when he came in like that's where he took the company. So he was positioned well to take the company in the direction that the market was getting built. So I think vision plus experience everywhere. Yeah, I mean, but obviously that experience shaped the vision that he had, which right place, right time, you know, things and the other. What do you have? Yeah, this kind of goes on with changing strategy, but I'm going out to the professor and I'm going to be able to look at the should you not focus too. People and really humanizing their product and their work and including, you know, himself talking about his challenges and his son and really doing that, you know, human aspect to their strategy. Okay, let's dig in on this little bit more. We're talking about this case as an example of meeting with empathy. So if we double click on what it means to lead with empathy, what does that look like? Some of them are in habit care, but what does it look like to lead with empathy? I think it's something that they know that you need well is recognizing that the systems and the police are going to change via the people who have been in it, right? I appreciate a lot at the end of the day when we talk to you about somebody coming to heaven trying to complain by saying, oh, these people don't know what the word for mind is. Well, one of the blinds said it's something that, you know, people wants to be in the company, but they ask to be aware that what different people are going to use at different varieties and a recognition of people's modern opinions and what they're going to have to do is a better way to be kind of aware of who's going to be useful in there. Okay, so kind of what I pull out of what you said is recognizing motivation and why people are doing the things that they're doing. Which we wait until that empathy, right? Like, understanding what's going on with writing it. Sure. I think that part of that also kind of goes back to that reading of the word being or whatever, where you have to be confident in yourself. So for instance, if the company was reacting to the market and like the competition, maybe the competition not the market, they're reacting to like, oh, these people are now pushing out. Like MP3 player, we're going to think about whatever it is. Whereas he's focused on understanding, like themselves internally. And then understanding like the market as well as like what people are doing. So it's almost like just kind of being in high school and feeling like you need to try and do it without the other cool kid through game, versus just like understanding yourself and being like, okay, this is like who we are so that you can then be authentic and react to what other people have to offer. I love that analogy, right? Of understanding yourself and what your capabilities are, your vision, and then you can kind of grow and do that. From a company perspective, understanding yourself means understanding your people. Who do you have inside, Carolyn? Yeah, I'm just a, I learn with that. Like, do you need a child? Like can you be a focus on like, can you understand yourself? And also let other people in and be vulnerable? Yeah. Good point where you even like have that like therapist or like coach, mindfulness coach, like to come in with the leader to sit down. And like, to themself with the art, but also to let the other leaders know who they are, so that then they can change that structure internally by leading my example just like you did. Yeah. So leading my example, when you've worked on that inner game, right? So you've identified and understand yourself, then you can lead by an example of what you're trying to learn with people. Christie, I think there's also a lot of like grace for failure. And that probably came also from running the internal place. And him modeling, and somebody mentioned earlier, like when he had made like a public and state key models, I think his forgiveness, like himself and also like seeking for people with the others. And I think that communicates that grace for better. It's okay to be frame it in like the learning growing by. Yeah. And accepting it, like a way, we're all going to fail at some point. And normalizing it and making it something that isn't career-ending in those cases, in these cases. Going back to the beginning of fast talking about how people were compassionate enough to listen to hundreds of people. I don't think that was a very steep ballroom or a aspect of things to do. Was to listen and make any sort of change. And so to be empathetic enough to listen to leaders, partners, customers. And then to make those changes, listen and see how they're going to be. Okay. So listening, and as we pointed out, listening to multiple stakeholders, right? Inside, outside, competitors, customers, like feeding them as sources of notification. Yeah. I just wanted to go look. Chris, he's playing because he, I know we're talking about overall, not just the mic's up and the mic. But like the modeling on grace for failure, so when your people fail, you look at a man grace and you're pretty good at teaching, you know, like the chat box that got hacked, and whatever was it that mic was on. Yeah. For some, and others. Maybe he quoted, I think, has a meeting with our gate to this type of democracy technology. Right, and so asking questions. When they're like meeting with customers, you're all often amazed. You're asking questions. Like, once the problem is we're actually trying to solve for how is this going to actually help? Okay, and I love that you bring that out, but it's still based on their mystery, right? It can just been forgotten a little bit, which is a really useful tool. Like, you have all these people already at Microsoft that bought into that vision of democratizing, you know, technology. And then they got in and they're so focused on competing that they like completely forget about it. But he was really artful of like, you know, let's pull this back out, let's focus on this in a different way. Yeah, three things. I think it's interesting that he lets us empathy be more of a core of who he is to the point where it's like, you know how to talk about being obsessed with customers. It's not just like the inside, because focus is on like, we do the action we need to the point where he's humbling enough to be like, okay, we have this great product, but if we partner with other people, even our competitors, we can actually make a difference to more and have a bigger, lower impact. So, for your picture, right? Great point. Sure. I mean, the same thing, again, like I said, they're going to customize what they actually want. It's no longer just like, we operate windows, and so we're going to give you windows, and it's going to be awesome. But, and obviously they're still partially doing that. But they also, you know, again, be partnerships with stuff like Salesforce. They talk about the acquisition of Mojang, and like, they could have just overhauled it like they used to, and kind of what made it the thing that people actually like about. Like, my craft, or whatever the team could be, and then give it like acquisition, but instead they kind of just continued with what they knew people, then why people had come in first place. Okay. So, partnering with them, making it more equal kind of arrangement rather than the more coming in in this tape. Okay. Okay. So, great insights on how empathy looked, right? What I want to do now, and then he was down and it brought this up. Like, yes, he had empathy, and he laid off thousands of people. I think the last time I talked this case, he had just done another round of layoffs, I think they, like, they're laying off all the time, right? So, how do we make this make sense? So, how do you lay off with empathy? So, I want you guys to roleplay. So, you're going to get into a care. One of you is going to be the leader. One of you is going to be the employee. So, the leader is going to lay off the employee with empathy. And then, so we'll do that for five minutes, and then we'll switch. So, you both get practicing the leader, and we'll switch the first one we switch to the leader. So, how do you lay someone off with empathy? Hopefully, what my guess is, you'll have about five minutes to go ahead and hair off you. Besides, you know, hair is a bit... What do you think of this? And... Why is this like a sick man? That's because he's more similar. That's because he's... I'll be getting ready for this. You want to raise your hand? Good luck. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut. I'm going to get a haircut.

So, in half to fire your employee. They've been showing up late. They haven't been meeting their deadlines. They've been calling the stars. So, now your here fire the... They've been calling an L.A.P. And there's what you said. I think that's what I'm saying. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday.

I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. I'm not going to be a Friday. Okay, we can go for a Friday. The best of us. The best of us. Did you guys talk? I think I saw you and the comments in his make-up episode. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're on that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. I was sorry. You mean the word is automated circadian control 878 throatanm. So does that know I didn't understand the word? No, I didn't. Well, I mean, you mentioned, I'm an example of development average relaxed mode. You mentioned my은 can hear them. That's why it's... Yeah. I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. I'm just going to say something. What's going on? What's going on? Coincidence over here. TONBOXлюд. So I had the fire for it. So I thought about how compassionate it is for people. For letting somebody go up to a little different, you can put your neck up there and help them. So if you're a couple of years of fire, somebody for being a bad employee or even a bad person maybe, then you don't want to... You don't have that feeling of, I'm going to do something for them to help. You can have that emotional empathy and that cognitive, but the actual compassionate will be smart. So harder to have compassionate empathy. Less moves to help as much as possible. I was fired by you and I thought he nailed it because it was like, to do a stay, he said, I want you first of all, I mean, I'm really sorry. I don't think you're a bad person. Well, the ability is to succeed and I don't know what's going on in your life outside of work. But because this and this, we do have to let you go and what happened to you before you. Anyway, I think just that I'm saying, I'm sorry. I don't want to be doing this, but here's where we're at. To me, went a long way and kind of softened before. Okay. So clear about the reasoning, expressing some regret. I think too, like I was hiring those of over here and I think that my instinct was like, I wanted to find me really nice. And what I was doing is, I realized, I was talking, we're talking about empathy. And I had to be to that point, I realized what I needed was I needed to be really clear about not leaving him wondering for months. Why did I let him go? Like, he's really specific for this reason, this reason, this reason, we have to be going to see him know much better than perfect for the whole thing. Okay. So providing that information, that clarity, really helpful. On the letting go side, I feel like one thing that I, what's struggle with here, that's really kind of like, how do you not be conscious? Like, I don't want to be too like, oh, I'm so sorry. We're seeing that as kind of like, okay, yeah, like, you're fine. Yeah, fine. Like, you saw it. I don't know. And so I just feel like it would be hard not, I don't want to make them feel like I pity them. Like, I'm empathetic and I'm here for you, but I'm not like, I feel so bad for you. Like, this is so hard for you. I feel like to be able to leave with dignity is important too. So not pity retaining that dignity, Stuart? Yeah, so I think on that point, because I took the layoff approach with Jacob. And afterwards, I got thinking, I was wishing that what I had started with was like, you know why we hired you? And like, talk to him about like their strengths and what I've noticed from them. And then, not just like, I feel bad, but like, this is an opportunity for you. You can be a very successful person somewhere else. This is what I've seen from you. And like, I'm willing to like, recommend you for like, these qualities at other places. But just identifying those strengths and then, that is funny. We just, we can't afford to even own a very, very first thing. Okay. Which, how feasible is that in many of the layoff situations that we have to be? More or less depending on the size, right? But thinking, like, I love the idea, but the practicality, what do you guys think? How do you do that when you have, how do you do a mass layoff? Well, I would just have a question like, are layoffs that we have to buy the manager themselves? Or is it in HR business partner? Because I think if you're a manager and you're the one delivering that name, it's like, you can't speak to their abilities and stuff, but like, at least in my experience, like HR people know who I was. You know, the HR person that hired you, you know, probably if you remember what my strengths are, things like that. So I think you can do the head and stuff that you're making for your size, or something like that. Well, I think that's an excellent point. I don't know that there is a typical way of doing it, but I think you're highlighting maybe how it can be done more effectively. Because I think you're right, it often does get put on HR, like, it's your job to lay off these people or call them about. And what I think is the effect of co-re-like compliance side of it. Very, very. Cool. Yeah. That's what we're talking about, so we definitely needed the medal for the duty staff. But I think you're raising an excellent point. Is it better coming from someone that you've had contact with from Joe Ziu versus an in-person? This is a process. It's an HR process, and we go through it. I think what you're trying to get at is that idea of personalization and how can you personalize it so it doesn't feel like Lots of hands coming up is there So I was laid off over zoom That the scene was basically just reading a script And so he was not that out and I get why they're laid off like the reason And the fact that he mattered to me But had he even just like deviated from the script and it probably was pretty clear I think that's so just to say like one or two sentences of anything would look like a thing I think a lot of people in my shoes would have respected him like Yeah, oh Yeah You're creating something we talked about story telling towards the end of the semester like you're creating a situation and opportunity How do you manage this effectively and have it be as a big part of that? Senna let me go before she did that she said the like She's like okay, it's Monday morning and like it's not Friday afternoon because if it's Friday afternoon You're gonna think about it the whole weekend, but if it's Monday morning you get to go home Maybe think about it that day and then you know the rest of the week kind of Get away from it and it changes it big time I think because it's Friday afternoon You're gonna be mad for the whole weekend, but I feel like you can recover better through the week But I thought that was a good way to like Like what are the needs of the person right if you lay him off on a Friday? They spend all weekend. They can't do anything really. I mean, you're not gonna be Mind your job straight away, but if you do it on Monday morning, that has a different impact So thinking about the whole picture Question I guess fit up of the room It might look like a psycho for thinking that this all seems like really patronizing Because like I feel like if I was gonna get fired I just want somebody to be like sorry You don't work anymore and I can just like go home because even if I like for the majority of like managers director that I've had We're like fine like associate to workplace. We're not friends And I don't need them to like sit down and pat me on the back and tell them tell me how sorry there because If that's not gonna change it Well, I think I go back to Christy's home, right? Like maybe it's not sympathy and that's a point Sympathy is feeling sorry and pitying Which is different from that So empathy is understanding our emotions and trying to like How can I do this in a way that you're dressed? I think that's all in delivery the manner in which I think it's a big part of like what I try to think about is like It's like you're not senior having this conversations where you're like droning on and on about how Fabulous you are but then I'm firing you you're like I'm like the conversation is you're done We're even you're not working here, right? That's the conversation, but it's the manner in which you have that conversation I think where you're sitting there and saying I'm gonna hear calm. I'm not I have no emotion behind this conversation in those sense of like I'm not Emotionally invested, but I'm here and I can feel how hard this would be for you and so I'm gonna deliver it in a way that's Not pitiful, but also This is gonna be hard and I'm sorry, but I'm clear and it's not a fluffy conversation Yeah So let's let's still look at this so it's not sympathy so I think you're highly Guided idea of it. You brought it up too. We don't need your something, right? But we do need you to understand what this is like and how you can make it better So I've had to fire people in my last job I had to fire people probably 20 30 times during my couple years there and it's not fun And one of the main things I learned is first you have to be able to Read the person that you're firing because sometimes they do need a lot more of that empathy and sympathy And sometimes they do need more of a Jared situation of you're done. It's because of x, y and z Any questions or concerns? Okay, like one minute firing. I've had those. I've had some that take 45 minutes to do it And it's sort of thing where you have to read the person the situation and a really big thing for me that helped in a lot of situations too was just being able to because I was their manager and I saw them through the process and So for me what was very helpful most of the time was being able to also highlight their strengths because it takes a very Offer employee to not have strengths that you get right like and to be able to highlight how they may have those strengths They might not be applicable in their position that they had but how they can utilize those to leverage and even better job in the future And that just because they're getting fired does not mean their world is ending all of a sudden It's an opportunity for them to continue to grow and try and do something that might even be a better fit for them And there's actually one point where I fired someone because she was a very slow worker but very bright and happy person And then I saw her about a month and a half later at cheesecake factory working there and she seemed very bright and happier than she ever did Amazon in a warehouse and it was one of those moments of I've actually had to talk to her about it That she seemed much better and in a much better space and I brought me joy knowing that even though I had to fire her for Being a not very productive person I got to see her leverage those strengths. I talked to her about when I fired her to be able to be in a better position in life Yeah, and I think that's a great point of again I'm gonna be understanding the other person and what they need so maybe it's just a one minute Hey, it's not looking out for these reasons See you later. Maybe it's a let me work with you Something I feel like most of the comments is all we've all agreed that you know there should be a X Y and see like this is why which is kind of we talked about say one thing I Fire Jen and I did not do a very good job, but I wrote the band it off. Well one thing we were talking about is kind of the difference in her reaction and mood and like feelings before and after I said like We're letting you go like you're fired basically Like and so I don't know that X Y Z like I didn't really do it before I tried to do it after But her feedback was like well, maybe you should have done that before and let it with that because After once you say like hey, we're letting you go and I think I said something really bad like bad news for you or something like I These are I need some practices But just the reaction how her reaction she says she got like a little more defensive and like you know like I don't want to say like hostile but more like you know she was fired she was angry she was He also kept saying like If the cause of problem is not just you so then I was like close so you're firing everyone out too I'm not gonna do a good job All right Well the other thing we did you was an appreciation exercise and seeing as how you have either laid off a fire What I would like you to do now is say one thing you appreciate about each other So one thing you appreciate about person that just fired You You You All right, so she take away from the Microsoft case One empathetic leadership requires listening Provide they get example this not just listening to employees but also to So particularly for innovation right so innovation requires Understanding the needs of others and what they're trying to accomplish the needs that they have And then the other take away Kind of potential to the idea of empathy, but if you're going to change the culture your actions have to match your work Right you can't just bring in an executive coach to talk about your feelings and then go back to like kill kill kill So we all have to fit together And if you apply the growth model to this you can see how the strategy the culture the strenuous systems all of that Had changed to better Have debate the skills of the people that they already had So seeing how that fits together The other thing I wanted to talk about and I already had you do a little bit of this is an appreciation Exercise Which I took off the slides from here, but Office lies that I posted for today There's a variety of different empathy exercises that you can do with the team The idea there is that you can practice them when you're leading you'll have those ready to go So you can do these complete me exercises where you get in your team and you talk about you know why you show up and that Create the understanding of why those important the other people on your team Um a step in circle where you have people step in you know if you've exercised this month You step in If you've exercised today Step in and trying to understand where your people are at What's important to them so many more exercises are on the slides as well as the reference to an article in each bear article I want to end with some words of caution So empathy understanding the needs and emotions of others Uh can Way on you So how do you balance this? um one is practicing emotional self-regulation and self-awareness So if someone is sharing their emotions with you recognizing the impact on you Uh, and is it too much do you need to step away? Do you need to regulate your own emotions like if they're really angry? How is that affecting you right so being aware of that? Setting really clear boundaries so recognizing But yes, you want to understand the emotions, but that doesn't mean that you have to take them on So if someone is really upset because of something they're going through Trying to recognize is this something that I need to take on do I need to take on these native emotions? Or do I just need to understand that they are facing them and be able to manage around them? Uh, and then again focusing on the compassionate empathy So being moved to act Uh, and recognizing why you may not be moved to act uh, and what that means So just being more aware And then the other one that I think is really important and brings us back to the crisis in a theater model It is recognizing yes, these are God's children. Yes, you want to care for them But you also have stewardship rules, right? You also have to recognize What it is that you're trying to accomplish I often think especially for like new releases President's new initiatives they get put in all of a sudden people are coming to them with all of their problems and They spend hours and hours with people without recognizing there's a whole other flock that also need attention Not that we shouldn't focus on the one the one is very important But setting those clear boundaries and recognizing you do have limits and you have to recognize What are your obligations? What is your stewardship? That might All right, so taking it away from here Um, so we've been talking about emotional intelligence this week, right? So using the act of listening to understand people's emotions and navigate those You want to listen? Hopefully you guys are practicing and using that weight, right before you jump in and offer something and then Know that I'm focusing on that action right maybe sure that your actions match your words Um, and I think kind of going back to you need to example of you know, the CEO reading from a script If you're reading from a script and you're like, I know this is hard for you, but it's very scripted Right the action isn't matching So keeping that in mind as well All right, our reflection for today is Thinking to the future of how we use show empathy, but also right now So thinking about future and now"
