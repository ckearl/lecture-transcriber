  "text": "more of us with peacemakers, so the bridge is of understanding rather than all the hedges, especially with those who may see the world different than we do. I have seen bitter divisions softly when neighbors choose to listen to one another with respect, rather than suspiciously. Even small acts like reaching out across landed-based culture of politics can open doors to human. There is power to pointing others with who they can lead that all of us will learn to serve. So, I'll just leave that with all of us in the trend process. Everything that happens is we can think about how we learn to forward. I wanted to share one cool thing. I think with President Nelson, there are countless numerous, perforated, but experiences. The history and the other forms, the guy who I've worked at, has a really cool experience with him. His dad was before that, I don't know, had a heart attack. This was a bunch of years ago. And so he could go down there and go do his dad, and have surgery, and that kind of recovered. And he met the heart-rich people that was operating on his dad. And they were just chatting and said, I'm from Utah, oh, the Mormons or whatever. And he said, yeah, he knows. The guy laughed. I'm definitely not Mormon, but I've patterned my life after one. And I think, you know, because he's a part surgeon, he just adored President Nelson from an entirely a career perspective. I think, but also the way he carried himself and the way he could think. And to me, that's really, I don't know, hearing that story, like, yes, I think there are really awesome ways he showed up for people in church settings, but the way he also carried himself and treated people in a professional setting, like, in body, that's right, that's what I'm doing. It was a kind of, very easy to do in a church setting, I think, in the press, like, we're not in the industry. That's a great reminder. It's a thing for us, it's part of the fact. That's funny. I had a similar story. My wife was born sure yesterday, but it was, someone was, their dad was getting a heart surgery, and he said, this doctor walked in and explained the procedure and walked us here and sat with us and talked to us. And he said, this has to be the greatest doctor there ever was. Like, the greatest bedside manner, like I've ever seen. And then they did the surgery and he was successful. And he said, after during the recovery of the doctor came in again and told, he said, this is the greatest doctor there. Or this has to be like the greatest person there. It was, of course, President Nelson. And he really lived with what he taught. In every aspect of his life, we talk about, like, how, in his career, he relied on the spirit and relied on the Lord for direction. And I think he really, there was no separation between church and career, who he was. Thank you. Great example. Definitely something we can all follow. I remember his story told about how he had a vision about how to do a surgery. And none of us are going to be doing surgeries unless you make a fair move. And you have to part with many point of view with this. But we do have intricate things that we do on a daily basis with a few of our lives. And we definitely rely on the spirit and help guys with those important relationships. There are matters in the heart that are not surgical. Okay. So this week, we are shifting gears slightly. So we've been focused on an individual level, like how do you as an individual, getting empathy, engaging active listening, doing these different behaviors as a leader. And now we're shifting to, well, how do you do this in a team context? What are some of the team related things that you need to be patient about? Psychological safety is a team climate. So it has to do with how safe people feel in the team in terms of engaging in certain behaviors, particularly related to admitting mistakes and when they come to the earth. So today we're going to focus on psychological safety on Wednesday. We're focused more on accountability. So these two obviously go together hand in hand and are important to strengthen climate. So our agenda for today, so what psychological safety is and why it matters. And then we'll dive into the case, how do you create a culture of psychological safety. And then we'll wrap up with intellectual honesty and what and why it matters. So starting with psychological safety. So it's a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk safety. So a few things are important in this definition. First is that it is a shared belief. So you can have variants within the team. So different team members may think it's more or less safe. But this is the team level construct. The idea that we as a team believe that it is safe for interpersonal risk safety. And so what are the forms of that risk safety? So the first one is speaking help. So asking questions when you don't understand, reaching out to people to get the help that you need. Another form of risk taking is admitting mistakes. Being willing to say, hey, I screwed up. I thought we should have used this formula, but we should have used a different one. Or we started with bad priors and now our results are off. So admitting those mistakes. Being willing to experiment is another risk taking behavior. So trying things as a team or in the team, seeing what happens. And then going from there. So being willing to fail essentially. But recognizing that that's an important part of the growth. And then the last one on here is accepting differences. So this has largely to do with differences of opinion, different backgrounds. Accepting people into the team and accepting those differences. What's interesting about psychological safety and how it's changed over time is there has been a lot more focus on this accepting differences and helping people be comfortable in their teams. And it's been interesting to see any advances work in particular kind of push back on this. It's just about being comfortable because in her conception of it, it was never about being comfortable. It was about pushing yourself, learning, growing. But in Ray LaCarla's people have always more on the comfortable team. You kind of see her in the article that I assigned for today. Cushing back a little bit on that. It's about being comfortable. It's always been about seeking help. Admitting the state. Experimenting, speaking up with Pander. But a lot of it has focused on this accepting difference. Which is part of it. But not the core defining feature of psychological safety. So why do we study this in a business context because it has benefits? So if you have a team who's engaging in these behaviors, you're more likely to have clarity of thought in terms of people sharing ideas, asking questions, pushing each other on those ideas to make sure that people understand that you're getting the best ideas. So really pushing each other on those ideas. And closely related to that is productive conflict. So a willingness to engage and discuss ideas bring up counterpoint and really, again, push each other. Another benefit is that it mitigates failure. So people are willing to speak up and say, hey, I think we're going off the rails here. Can we readjust? Is there a way we can mitigate this failure that's potentially coming up instead of just continuing and going off the cliff? So admitting your mistakes and being willing to fix them. Also promotes innovation. We'll talk about this again at the end. But this idea that if the environment feels psychologically safe, you're more willing to offer those ideas and work towards something that's different. And then removing obstacles, so if you're willing to ask questions that you get mistakes, that's going to remove those obstacles that might keep you from performing well. So you're going to question your assumptions and also push the team to do things that they thought that they couldn't do before. All right. Any questions about psychological safety in this question? Okay. All right. So how do we create a culture of psychological safety? Go ahead. All right. Paige, I'm coming to you first. Okay. So the question is, Rose, begin or can you write having no regrets on the sequence? The relationship changes in the leadership team. So why do this first? I think if you are able to get your leadership team on board with conversations that talk through making decisions and thinking people involved, it trickles down from there, right? If you can get your leaders on board with, for sure, the culture of making people feel safe and making people feel like they can make decisions and be innovative, right? That trickles down to your employees and to how they feel and to making them feel comfortable and safe in doing so as well. Okay. So trickle down the fact that you're going to start with your leaders first. Other thoughts on why to do this first? I think part of it is really just setting your expectations because they were struggling a lot and they need something to all work together like to have the bind or work together for one direction and you can't do that if everybody's working for it's different things. Okay. So setting those player expectations and making sure everyone's on the same page. I think that something important is to know the person and allow that they know you in order to gain confidence. So how would that work? How do you know each other from a no regrets conversation? We better say like it was motivation, but they want to come back. I'll clarify those motivations. She, I remember that I recall talking about how she was basically thinking about that. And I find that with that level of transparency, you know, coming from a cyber competitive room to that makes it so you know people don't have the old period of notice that they have to be taking real love. Okay. I'm wanting to be clear about what your motivations are, what your expectations are so that when you are talking out loud, people know what your intent is and aren't misinterpreting. I don't think maybe she meant for this, but it was kind of like a leader to see who would actually be on board and who wouldn't. So the company somewhat seemed like different functions and stuff. So kind of the people who were there actually wanted to do this and be there again. And you, you had to say to like a mother she meant to do that. What do you guys think? Do you think she meant to be? I think it's kind of half to move back. Yeah. There's some people who are just, you know, just, you know, thinking through a whole range of plans if they don't want to do it but say they want to do it, I don't know. So you kind of have to give them out. Yeah. Which is a pretty blank way of going about it, right? Coming in and having these conversations and definitely you can get it as a way of finding out who's on board and things like that. There's like a psychological principle where it's like if you get sick in an environment you can't return to the same environment where you got sick in. And I think that's kind of what an example to get better basically, right? So I think this is kind of that similar. Like if this is a situation where, you know, we've problems we're building and we don't want to go back to that, you have to change the situation or the environment so that you can get better basically. Okay. So change in that environment. You can really clear about it. I just weekend I was actually reading for the leadership book, like reading about Jack Welch, CEO of the GE. And these are the part of what I've been reading and talked about time before when he took over a new department and realized that there were several new departments that were very unsuccessful. And at one point he basically went in and found like a mid here person looking back through. And the other than to be the new leader to the next year, I just get back going to end up having to fire almost every single one of those people who was earlier before because they've become so consistent. But it was kind of like over time and sort of getting that game of who can actually be able to get back on the floor and become a non-complicant. And so I think the big part of it is just that, not just going in and getting rid of people, but figuring out who is right to be caught back up and get ready. And then being like I think I said that flat out of the six required, but that there was one person actually out to be able to get things going again and actually get through those and get them to be comfortable. Okay, so again that idea is kind of cheating with that leader of giving us that opportunity to show that there are more than they're committed and they want to do this, but not assuming that they are. Right? That is a big important aspect. Thanks for sharing. Okay, so we see that she comes in and does this and why she does this first. What do you guys think? Is this a good decision or something that seems to have worked out for the next? Let's just say definitely a good decision. What do you guys think? And we want to offer a contraption point? Well, it worked out for her, but it really depends on the situation. Like she pretty much started like a culture revolution within the Western Europe company, right? And she has support. Like she has people on board. If she starts something and people would like no we don't want to do this because everybody right there, like open countries, they would have just like looked before their own business and not looked before the whole company, like perspective. But like if she doesn't know what she has back in the time, she might have failed and then that's what I'm saying. Like you may just happen. Not because she just pure luck, but of course she had like also experience and all that at that time. But yeah, that's what I was saying. I was like, you know, she tried lots and lots of different things. She's always experienced that way. She feels like a lot of the situation. She was very persistent. She's willing to do the job. She was trying things. Joseph? I was going to say she's definitely taking like, from the context of cyclical, safety, she's taking pretty big risks. Like if I'm in a environment where I just got to kind of people get to different positions, like I'm not like in the papers. I'm not likely to be like savings that I'm going wrong or the trying to get into. So I think that has to be coupled with really intentional building up a culture of cyclical safety otherwise look at the other ways. So in terms of what it needed to be successful, was that emphasis on cyclical safety and culture change? Well, to be the contrary here, this point came from a roadie picture. It's like a senior religious book from a white person who came to Michigan, Morgan and Lost Walkville. This kind of thing happens all the time where like senior leaders fill in and have like fun and the treats where they learn about religious conversations. So I talked about it for 30 seconds on a call and like it doesn't change anything from the culture of the actual company. And so like it makes them feel good but it really does not completely happen. Okay, so do you see something different from what Rose was doing? Okay, and John, you're going to come in today and we're going to build the team of cyclical safety. You talk about it for 30 seconds and then you go back to the business as usual. I mean, I guess you wasted a retreat. But it's great for that. Yeah, I'm sure they have their nice little retreat wherever they go. Maybe not leading to the effects they wanted. So then did you have... Oh, I was actually going along with that group of people. I was going to say just that we actually saw the case that people asked where they got the first team together. We're all kind of freaked out. They're like, am I next? Am I the shopping blog? And so I feel like this could have actually backfired if she actually wasn't good in a personal relationship with helping everyone. So definitely that first meeting had an impact in terms of what she was able to do. Monty? Yeah, I do have a piece of advice John can bring up here. A lot of her lies on patterns, right? You, please call you back, but coming into this, or probably you really have, I certainly have a good day of planning the eyes as far as what you would like to do. And so I do choose understanding and aware of the fact that single comments are true. This, you are factagotic, you know, a human being. And the thing is you actually have to play down from that, that you have in the series. It isn't just a win. You know, I'm new, but I'm going to be nice as things go on. I'm going to get a place to work about it. You have to stick to the rules and circumstances. Okay, so think about the behaviors that she needs to engage in consistently in order to make this work. Is there anything else about Rose herself, her background, that suggests that she can make this kind of shit in the organization? She had proven success in her other role, so she kind of had that credibility. Okay, so she's been successful in the UK and that's been great. She did a bunch of good stuff in the UK thing. I think it won't be said she'd never ever missed a quarterly goal until she got aside this new role. She was good at being good before. Yeah, met goals and was consistent in that. Anything else about her and her background? Well, I just heard when we were reading before the case, we had that little two-night view of the interlocutor honesty with the psychological safety. I feel like yes, it's for a team, but also the leader has to be mindful of those. So the question was both open with them and great to that psychological safety. But she herself was very intellectually developed and jammed honest with her feedback. This is a, you can document everything moment, or this is our failure. She was very open with the purpose of the different discussions. I think that combined with this kind of intelligence and proven success, which kind of helped it be more innovative rather than just a touching feeling party. Yeah, but isn't exactly what it feels like, right? It's not, you know, we're wanting everyone to be happy and that kind of thing. It is that ribbon to success, James. Well, she's studied in the US and then have roles all over the world. And I feel like just that diversity of experience probably helped her feel to understand like a broad array of people and personality types. It's kind of an assumption, but... Yeah. Can we assume that experience that she's understanding the other 14 different countries, different perspectives, and bring that experience in? Yeah, so on page four, it's had a lot of people come to her like how she is like quite a candor. And then, I'm just saying that she's very experienced in some of things. Otherwise, it's like someone said it could backfire. Psychologic safety is a very important thing. But if there's too much psychologic safety, I'm just saying like... Just like on the reading, Steve Jobs called some of the people who are here said they say too much shiss. Like if you don't know how to direct a composition back to where it needs to be, it could backfire. Okay, let's go look like on this question. Can you have too much psychological safety? What would that be? What does that look like? Kind of direct as viewers come in. I think that's where you don't have the intellectual honesty side of the driving completion. So there's not these healthy debates, healthy disagreements that are helping you. I think for mental and brain sugar relations, for everybody, just to see if they're failing, comfortable failing. And questions, everyone's very comfortable with that. Okay, so aside that it might be too much, it's too comfortable failing. Okay, so recognizing that there are levels there. I had a boss that would want to hear everyone's opinion on everything sometimes. And meetings would last four or five hours at times. Or it was just like it should have been a 30-minute meeting. Here's what's going on. Obviously there's some kind of stakeholders that need to contribute. But it was that far end of the spectrum. What's your everyone's thoughts on what we should be doing as a company? And it was like, no, we dreaded those meetings because anytime you want to just get together, it was like good luck for us today. Okay, thank you too much time to discuss too much. I think also it could be just like a misunderstanding of the concept too. Like, kind of similar to what you mentioned earlier about the different facets of psychological safety and focusing too much on just like, making it different so the making sure everybody feels good. I think true, true, true psychological safety also makes room for like a lot of time or getting feedback and kind of like tackling hard things. So I think, I don't know, kind of creating like a common definition among the team of what that actually is and what that includes. It was like maybe some hard stuff too. Not just like that, it's such a good stuff. Okay, so kind of identifying a solution is agreeing on what psych safety is. And that includes hard things as well. All right, Alice and the GF. I think it could start to order on lacking respect because I do still think that there needs to be like, there's a leader for a reason, right? And it's like, if like, order things, like if everyone's voice is equally as hard as just leader, why would you have to leader? Right, so it's kind of like, I don't know, I would just worry about it. Getting a lot in that way and respecting. Okay, seeing the role of the leader and making decisions, we think along. Yeah, I don't know how my last company, everyone was soap, would like that nobody would say no to an initiative or anybody would, if they weren't doing anything. There is a thing we wouldn't go forward but like, you expect that if your ideas weren't good and you never, like, you see that feedback in the end of the video. Okay, which goes to that idea, like everyone gets a trophy, so who actually is exceptional. So if no one says no, do you know if it's a good idea? I'm not filtering that way. Jake? I feel like in the reading, they talked a little bit about how people's confidence, kind of like Alice was saying in respect for the leader, it would diminish if they were given the actual feedback or work well in the county. So if they're not motivated to actually, or if they feel like the leader is not going to hold the accountable to your standards or to making any changes, then even if they're comfortable reading something out, they're not really going to move forward and also they're not, if they're not confident the leader will follow through with a suggestion or with an idea, then they're not going to break that, be there, even if they feel safe to do so because it's not going to happen. Okay, so a lot of accountability can be an issue here. Jen, I was also kind of bouncing off with Alice and Jake said that not just like the role the leader in college diminishes how they're seen, but I also think that we work too comfortable. They forget that they're in a work environment and they'll just do whatever they want and so professionalism can go out the window. Okay. Which is actually supported by some research as well, that when psychological safety in terms of that, accepting differences is really high, people do start just saying whatever and they aren't actually motivated to get the work done. So, Jacob. One of the readings is it talks about things like people can say, if you're making better listeners are important, that there are means, not ends. And it's neat about John's comment as well about leaders saying good things, going through retreats, and not actually diminishing it. I think those leaders are also confusing the means and ends, that saying these good things aren't the ends, those are the means that should drive you. Yeah. Great way of bringing that. Thank you. So thinking about these, as you have objectives you're trying to meet, to create an environment where people can use this desk full, but just saying, you know, we should all listen to each other. Kind of going back to the accepting differences. I feel like that one has to, I don't know, to prevalent. I think there can be a lack of innovation, a lack of like conflict that drives that innovation, and before too accepting of everything, I think that kind of drives just complacency, as well as, I guess just getting back to the point of like, there's never a sense of ideas when you're too accepting of everybody's attention. Okay. So you want to have a little bit of conflict, right? Get some debate going, etc. I think kind of jumping up with a couple things there, like there has to be a level of desixiveness, like it is a business. So we have to make a decision, and then we have to drive forward together, and the team, and the people are thinking, oh, I didn't totally agree with that decision, and then they keep like pushing back on it at some point, it's got to be the decision we've sent before, or the business will never be able to respond to anything that you've got. So kind of going back to Corbin's idea, like if we spent five, six hours listening to everyone's idea, and not actually making progress, it's just sitting next to you and our other. All right, Anna and I'll come. I feel like, I feel like, I think, I think these comments, like, are professionally appreciated for everyone. Oh, I feel like I'm not an idea, but my idea wasn't accepted, and I was like, other things, there's a risk of people feeling like, this risk, because they were like, oh, oh, I get kind of black conflict, which is not really being able to come. There's a leader, this is the idea, this is what we're doing. Here's how we can all get on board together, versus kind of everyone's spouting ideas, but why are you both better at anything? There's a little way. Okay. So again, going back to this idea of conflict, right? And so how do you balance, you know, how do you people's ideas curve in a way that is productive, and not just getting wheels, not too much conflict, but not too little kind of balancing, including that, right? Yeah, great question. Just a, I've been this whole discussion, and thank you, if you could carry it through your time, but at the end of the day, the whole idea of this is like, this isn't your home, but I guess I'm pushing back, it's like, we can't build the utopia. I guess what I'm trying to say is, there has to be a balance of options, we still have to be profitable, and is building this perfect work environment and at the expense of not being profitable or worth it. I guess I'm a bit of a singular perspective probably not, but I don't know, that's kind of like the thought I had, and I think you need to have some, like, that act of, and then it was well-ticking to keep those balance, though, like, this perfect work. Okay, so I'm curious, I want to hear more. So this idea of like, profitability, so in your mind, tell me the confidence that you see between, because I guess first, it's a fine, like, the utopian work environment, what is that? Yeah, like, like, snow white, like, in her, like, how many dorses did she have? I feel like it's a little bit more like, all of this is going to help us to be more, that's not like, I think we've been more profitable than, let's do it. But if we're just going to get a straight, straight work environment, but it's not affecting the bottom line, and the bottom width, then it's like, was it worth it? Okay, so how do I go back to, I think it was Jacob that was saying the least in the ends, right? This idea of we still need to be focused on the ends, and this should be a means to work through the ends, so not that we can't have a good work environment, just that we need to remember that we are trying to do it. Yeah, it's like, what's the moment of the work we do in this? Okay, appreciate it. Alright, so. I've been thinking about it a little bit, and I feel like this is all great, but I also think the pieces of the life that I took to learn and I was crossing over at the home and work life, where it makes it a lot easier for people to bring their home life into work and work life into the home. And I was thinking about that, and there's been a recent survey over the last few years that essentially, I think it's 80% of people say that work has more of an impact on their emotional well-being than their home does, and I feel like that's a bit of an issue where it's becoming a point where people can't turn off work when they leave work. And we do spend a lot of time out work, so it makes sense that it has a big impact on us, but we also work to live, we don't live to work. And so when it becomes a point where work is our, like how we are at work, it's how we are in life, that's made feel like a bit of a problem. And so that becomes a, how would we, what's the best way to still have a good work life, while not having that work, like you come out of life, and then go forward and that's how it's going to work. Because the fact that we're focused so much on, it's all here, home life work, that we're also then, that when we're at home, part of the thing is how was at work, what was going on, and it doesn't make it a lot easier for one of these to go bad, taking the house that, and maybe it's down to them within the head of the house, and it becomes such a sense of work life instead of just being a spoke of how we live our life. Okay, so kind of a philosophical question about the boundaries between work and home life, and how much of an identity we've got to work in, Alright, I saw some other hands before I move on to the next question. This comment might be a little bit different. I actually don't think there's too much. There can be such things too much. I think there can be such things too little about it. And what I mean by that is, I feel like, I feel like it's a Christ-like leadership model, there's like, one for the individual, and then stewardship for the organization. I feel like most of these comments are saying, oh, if we're not a good spiritual organization, then there can be too much blood. But I actually think that's false. I think actually, like, we need to keep the stewardship for the organization, and then you're loved with people in balance. If you want to increase your drive for the organization, I feel like you also have to increase the amount of blood that you get if I do something. If you're trying to get more love, and get more psychological safety, you also have to balance that with more drive for innovation, it's like using the results that we want to see. And we want to give you the power to get out there and fail, and get out there and try things, and get out there and feel like you can express your comment without feel of distribution. And I feel like this thinking that we do too much of that. I don't think that's the balance with the organizational stewardship. All right, Christian Dungeon. Yeah, I agree. Like, I'm in the camp, but there can't be too much when it's like, when it's the right kind of psychological recovery, and there's no psychological safety. Like, I feel like I've had experiences in companies where like, there's none, and it's really anxiety and do you say, and I actually feel like to down point, I take more cognitive weight more when there's not psychological safety and lean more anxious about it. And then on the other hand, when there's kind of a performative psychological safety, or it's just like, looks like you get pretty good, and I'm really feel safe. That's not my perspective either. But I've had a couple of really great leaders that I feel like kind of get to like the actual heart of what this is. And I feel like nothing suffers. If we're all better for, obviously, it's not perfect, but it's like, those were the most effective teams that I've been on. It's when there was no path to cognitive psychological safety. And like, we failed, but we failed fast. We were also like motivated to be more, to do better, so I didn't come at the expense of sharing our failures. So anyway, I guess no point in my cognitive life I agree. It's like, it's like, it's like, it's a cognitive problem. You know, I was actually thinking about that. I actually do love feeling loved at work because it does help me thrive. However, and I guess my perspective is just time and place because you can love your employees and make them give them psychological safety. But I also think time and place because sometimes in a team you're going to have to say, we have 30 minutes to talk about this, so that you keep kind of that structure. But then I can give that one-on-one love, and I want one-on-one, so you still feel that, but you keep the structure of the team. I think it's kind of balancing that between one-on-one so they feel safe, to bring this thing up, but also keeping, you know, the meeting efficient in effect. Okay, so thinking about that structure in the role of a place, and going back to the stewardship angle of the price of nearly a mile, right? Like, what are their structure and objectives? All right, Stuart. I also would say, like, it doesn't mean to positively affect your bottom line. I think if your bottom line stays the same, it's still better. Like, there's some of the out there that's making like, power out that covers, and the demand for that, I don't see that like, going up or down very much. But if they're able to work more effectively as a team, and people are able to feel safe, or whatever it is in that environment, their whole life is now better, has a company, and I think that is positive, or whether or not the bottom line goes up. I don't think you want it to go down, you don't want it to be a detriment to your work, but as long as you're like staying at equal, I think it's worth investing in having them. Okay, so different ways of measuring success. All right, I want to move us on to how they created a culture of psychological safety. So, Valena, I'm coming to you in terms of what are some of the things, some of the interventions that they did, they create psychological safety. Failure parties. Okay, so failure parties. Does anyone experience failure parties? I mean, a party is kind of like, how it is, like, but yeah, just like, meaning where that was like, was there, and almost going to celebrate. So I had a gathering. Yeah, so I was on a business and telling this team, and we did an adult, so every time we got a retro, and we discussed some new developments that they'd go out and have a new group, and some of the advantages, like, just like, oh, I don't know what to do. I'm just wondering, maybe you can make that happen. But if it's never that, it's really interesting just this time, like they said, it was always like, you know, we were all very close to each other, and we were able to address things with a very large, okay, so the expectation that we're going to bring this up, we're going to learn from it, and keep going. So we have to hide these others. Other experiences, so. My, Ballon and Lon is business, and since it was the evil, the evil award. So the story of that is like, you know, the guy who, like, wanted to, like, ride his bicycle, like, over to the tramp Canyon, you know, obviously, did not work very well, but it was kind of an interesting way to, like, celebrate. Like, dude, like, you took the wig swing, and I threw it really, really good through to that. We're both going to work out, but like, we appreciate you getting a link about him, or, like, But awesome. We'll show you what evil people I like about him. Examples of where a failure was supposed to be celebrated, and then, Vigia and the back, when it turned against you? You know, what else is going to be about the office, and this is the ethics. My, I said, you know, it's safe space, and people just spread it through, and that didn't sound like the dresser, but it's just, this is the whole time I was getting about that. How it can be mishandled. Yeah. So, it's safe space, and when there's other parable effects, it's not really safe space. I had an example, so we, a few years ago, we're trying to normalize how many injections we get. So, as a professor, we send an article to journals, and they get rejected, like, all the time. And so, we have this monthly newsletter, and so, we're trying to normalize this. I was like, okay, I'll put in my rejections in there. Well, my department sure thought that everything was good and rejected, and he didn't think I was going to be ready to go up for tenure. And I'm like, oh, no, I actually in getting some things through, but, you know, the ratio just looks off. So, I no longer report any of my rejections. But it's not ideal, like, we're trying to normalize it, and make it not ideal, but still, it looks like some people think so. You have to have everyone bought it, and how to have that definition, and we're ready for it to work. So, I have times where a lot of the things had somebody use starting a position, and so, they said it's like, hey, this person is learning, this person is going to be, like, getting, like, putting their swings in basically. So, like, we're going to make sure to count for that, make sure to plan for it, and then, kind of retroactively, six months later, was like, like, why are you guys missing out so much? So, it was, like, kind of, like, changing the rules after, like, they tried to create that sense of being okay to fail, or being okay to grow into it, but then, pulled the rub out on those seconds, and so it was like, oh, we kind of had to remind it, we'll see that. Okay, so those failure parties, you can't change the rules, right? And, over for them, if you use that, I think. Ben. This, I think, is bringing up, potentially, the idea, when you have a failure party, it's not my case for you, you can take on what the failure is, so, all the questions in your failures were, some might be acceptable, some might not be. So, we'll be clear on, okay, so this is what we're doing, our failure party on, let's learn from this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, um, That one is blindsided when they actually get it. Alright, no. I don't know. I've been such really clear on the digital, as you know, what parts is needed. Why did it happen? It doesn't turn out to be a linear enough filler. And it's been a little bit exciting. So, getting the most working out of it, you can't just... I can say some of my fat. I can't remember who pushed back on the idea of like, failing fast. We shouldn't be purposely failing. So, I think we don't want to misunderstand this. Failure part isn't like saying failure is good. We should all strive for failure. But like, failure is inevitable. So, let's learn from... I think that's a good thing. It's not just about sharing failures, so we all know better about ourselves. Everyone else is failing too, but we're figuring out how to not fail. Maybe the true failures is when you fail for a few mistakes and fail. The same thing, failure, price, or oven, because it didn't change. So, focusing on the word, Jake. Is the backpack that cases, for instance, is a way of processing, sharing, intelligence that failed. It's not just anything in general, but it was, hey, this was a good idea. We approached it in a smart way, and it still didn't work out. We're pretty much not. Can I put those expectations? Yeah, just along those lines, like I just had a backdoor orientation, we did hand-to-lips, and like, any of our teams, we kind of get saying that like, very first activity, we just literally was going the entire time like, thinking about what to do. And we didn't get close. And then it was like, after that, I thought we'd killed it because it was like, okay, stop thinking, just try something. Someone has an idea? Sweet. Go try it. That didn't work. And then we would get to where we were, you know, in fact, learning from them to say, not being standing over and over again. And I think it's easier to do in that situation when it's not full-body on the line, like, the buzzer goes off when we didn't do it. But I think trying to get an analysis for analysis of just like, in my mind, that's like, why are you so very failure? We fail to get to this point, but the failure of worst-epping points, not just like a, well, like, and then I'm going from sales background, so it's like, failure is just to be good at using quota. And that's sometimes hard to like, you know what I'm talking about? Because it's like, well, I mean, you can't be like, or harder. That's not always the solution. There's lots of things to play there. But I think as long as you are actually progressing through the failure, then it's actually not good. So we get focusing on that learning. I think it's very interesting that it choose to frame this as a family party, because ultimately in all, all our discussion, it's like the focus on like, mind-hiding learning from it, and learning from each other's mistakes. I think it would be interesting to see if Microsoft really brings it as like, mind-hiding learning or whatever, to see if that would instill more of like, okay, what would you learn from this mistake? How can we really make it better? And like, if that would be the issue, I'm not talking about this. Okay. Which is an excellent question of how do you frame things? Like, so they're changing the framing around failure. You can frame it more around learning some sort of like, failure parties, learning parties, what, you know, really emphasizing that learning part of it. Yeah. I totally agree. Something I do in like, job interview, is you know, every little class you go about, the time that you failed, you know, it's something on those lines. And I always try to make it like, something that I used to not be good at, or something that I had previously failed at, but then succeeded in, so that I can then emphasize kind of that point of, well, you know, I had this, we could both look, you know, like, now, I am hell, but I contribute here from the area. Exactly that tone right there. Okay. So we have the failure parties. One part of creating this psychological safety culture. What else? Office hours. That was something that was just, yeah, open conversation, or at least the point of having that. Okay. And what are office hours supposed to do? Open conversation. Just a lot of them to grade issues directly with her energy. Okay. So, grade-thing issues, questions, right? Making it okay to not have the answer, right? And to seek that, seek that help. Let's be, I stopped short-maintenance, go up, or you think you on service too. I was thinking appreciation rooms. Okay. Appreciation rooms. So, the goal was to celebrate some great moments and essentially, my mother's effort. And what I could buy was that, I think I was like, having a rare, for her colleagues to see, for their contributions for her. So, in the last company I worked for, it was very rare, I appreciate it around. Excuse me. And so, when somebody would appreciate my effort, I wouldn't cry because it's competition. Because it was like, you got to say, somebody feels that for a set of contributions that. So, this was incredibly powerful for Microsoft and their senior closest leadership because they made them very safe and appreciated and cultivated more honesty and motivation. Okay. So, the appreciation rooms, recognizing the contributions that you're making. One thing I thought was super cool about the office hours is that it was a time for roads to push back on people. And she was like, they skips on it, and she'd be like, well, why can't you do it? Like, what's talking? What's blocking you? Yeah. And that's why I found this super beneficial is like, they have this beyond one time to talk about the problems that the company is going through and then to challenge all the assumptions that are kind of already baked in as a problem, which I think is what drives their innovation pretty effectively. So, demonstrating that coaching minds that by challenging those assumptions, what are those blockers? How do you address those? So, using that time that way. I think that rapport between the three parties in office hours is a side view of the purpose of our meeting at home in the process, right? To look back a little bit on the framing of, on my idea of my frame during the first part of it is if you don't want necessarily people to always come to road with like, oh, is it a problem that I already solved by the criteria that I already dealt with? She wants to be actively there as there. So, that's who you guys will point to. Otherwise, you're going to have people who are like, oh, why feel the same? So, their partnership is going to avoid it from the rest of my time. Yeah. So, making it open, we can come to solutions, but that coaching minds, and you probably have the solutions that I didn't help you find them out. Well, I just, I mean, with all these things, I think City should really get job of realizing that transformation takes a lot of time. And with an organization that's big and complex is this, I mean, there's like, under her view, there's like 12 different languages that are like the first spoken language in those different subsidiaries. And so, I think, maybe to push back on the idea of like, well, maybe the retreat was useless or whatever the case may be. Like, the failure parties came up three years in a different tenure. And I think maybe those retreats have to happen to figure out who's on your side, and who you can, like, generate some buy-in momentum with in order to make that change in the future. Okay. So, building piece by piece, recognizing that it takes time in a variety of different ways. Yeah, something else I found interesting about the office hours, that she didn't have a side agenda. I'm someone that likes to have backup plans in case there is. And I'm not beside that, because that he offers my lenses. So, that's what she made that space. And also, I encourage people to be vulnerable. And she was willing to be vulnerable herself. So, just sending us like this for her, and we'll get some office hours. Okay. So, vulnerability, front-wheel leader, is part of this, making that possible. I was also mentioned in the vulnerability, I couldn't find it, but eventually, somewhere that she was the first person to have breakdown of walls and be vulnerable. And that allowed everyone to be so comfortable doing the same thing. And stepping out of silos and falling out of that pool. Yeah. So, modeling, something that's all over the place. Okay. Okay. Finally, the windows. Something that I've also thought of interesting is like that for me on creating a shared language. Because ultimately, culturally also, there's always a different focus on what is important. And some cultures are, you know, something else. Like, it's really important, and another culture is something else. But, specifically in that role, how many, it's really important to have that shared language, and how that shared role. So, we all know where to focus on it. Yeah. Which I thought was a really interesting part. Like, having everyone read the same book, so they had the same words to use, and this shared understanding. I was actually going to read the same thing, this happened in the middle of a book, and I thought it was just interesting, just having our earlier discussion about psychoanalysis. It was just like, fierce, and with respect, it was only say the word psychoanalysis. Because if you were not all saying the same thing. And so, I think like many people on the same thing. And I thought it was a psychological organization, like reading a book, knowing, talking about it. Going back to her, she's quite earlier, like agreeing on the definition of psychoanalysis. Right? What does she do? And then, everything in the case that she was also obsessed with many customers. So, I think that the stuff that she's asked, she might, be related with this, because she was able to understand, and then care team and the programs that they have. So, at the end of the day, focusing on their angles and what they're trying to achieve, and seeing this as a means, getting to this end. Yeah. Right? Did you have your hair? I did. You're like, why did she say, they run air? I'm not sure. Okay, so the question of the case is, whether to hold this psychological safety workshop when layoffs are impending. So, as you guys thought about that, who thought, yes, continue to have these workshops? Okay, so majority, that's majority. Who thought, no? Okay, so, let's hear the reasons for yes and no. Those of you that are no and in the minority, do you want to go first? I'm sorry. We're a pretty good guy. I'm close to you. So, I've got time. I mean, just going right back to the panel and the hammer on the table at least you are. But, there's a lack of authenticity to begin with, which is just highlighted in those situations. And so, like, again, it's great for the senior leadership to go and spend a couple of nine bucks to hang out at Geneva. Then how about that? It's just dinner, dinner, and dinner. Yeah, yeah, even then. So, then, like, doing that and then turning around and talking about how great the experience it was and how great they learned at the same time, that before me and we all did, it creates even bigger disparity between what the leadership is saying and what the company, you know, is culture. And the thing is, there are a lot of things about this and how it's said. One thing is, I don't know, it could be like a lottery system, like how people throughout the entire organization come. Obviously, you can't do this on a two-month-a-hour person company. But, if you have, say, everything from an executive director or two senior vice president to just an operation member at all, maybe that can filter that cultural change throughout the company as opposed to just what's off the bottom. Okay, so why do you think it is one solution for making it open? But the big concern here is, yeah, it's often just, it's actually real or does it set up further disparity? All right, yeah. It kind of goes along with that. I would want to know how many of the 10,000 layoffs are in those areas. So that's one thing I would want to know because if it was the majority there, then I think the reasons that John said are very much more apparent. But if it's, they're doing pretty well in the company as a whole isn't doing that well, then maybe there is more reasons for them to continue doing what they're doing. But I do think that authenticity is kind of a big thing because you have to have the actions behind it. Those are way more important. Okay, so unclear where the last are or where they're coming. So how do you balance that? All right. Anyone else on the no side? So I was part of 20 different New York's and all three years where VP came into this exact thing, kind of what John said. And they never really worked. And they would go spend a lot of money using a tree, and then they'd come back and basically just lay out a bunch of people and they'd say, oh, I'm done now. And so I think that you have to be really aware of what that looks like, the rest of the world, like, I mean, you don't have to spend a lot of money to do a tree. Yeah, you can do it in your office, right? So it just looks bad. Okay, what does it mean? Right? It doesn't mean you don't even go to the end of it. Well, can we switch the audience? Okay. But you also want to send a paper no good. You don't want to catch these hands. Sick of James. This is an excellent one right there. I'm just curious to clarify a detail. There was an offsite that was really different from what the workshops are. I don't think this is like an in-clarify. I don't know for sure. This isn't like, let's have a whole of retreat for all the leaders of Dr. Ops. I thought it was safe. These are like workshops throughout the organization. These are more throughout. So it isn't that leadership summit. It is more throughout the organization. But it's still a lot of question. Okay, so what are the arguments for doing that? Correct. I think you can don't do it. It's not something that you should not have. It shows like, right over here, just playing around with us. You see how they're inspired. You don't know when you just show up. You kind of don't do that. Okay. So still that I do often, you see? I don't think it's going to be easy. But yeah, it's not a thing that they have to figure out. I don't know. You get a best situation. And don't you do your favorite again. Okay. Do we keep this consistently? All right. Let's go to Corbin. I just felt like he was like, yes, but he needs to adapt the workshop to have these work for them. So it was like, I just didn't feel like, if you didn't have it, he lost the luxury of... Culture is not a luxury. It's like a strategy, right? It's something that's a long-term success. That in the moment, yeah, you can go, oh shoot, hard times. Let's just throw all that out the window. But I think that also signals that they don't really care about progress or change or things like that. Okay. So TPS versus TD Green does a lot of monitoring. Yeah, I think these have been set of foundation. In certain sense, if you say, oh, we're going to skip this time because we're doing the way out. And if you're going to have a lot of work in the beginning of the certain circumstances, remember that it's, hey, either we have these conversations or we fire people. Whereas you don't really want that tone. And the other thing is, you're turning the green to make a good point earlier about the idea of, what is your accountability and, again, in the line, because you have a responsibility towards your statement. What is your statement? What is your responsibility? You have a huge investment towards that tone show there, wrote, even if they're not related to the company. And an opportunity for feedback, even if they're not going to be here for these after, using that opportunity, is it a disservice to you? So thinking long term, sorry, Anna and then Donald. Kind of along with that. I feel like having psychological safety is critical for those who aren't being laid off. Because after layoffs, there's this whole, who's going to be next with theality? And that's what they were just fighting against, what they're trying to resolve. And layoffs can still happen because the people who remain need to be too express that level of uncertainty, a complicated vulnerability, in order to get back into an innovative mindset. Because if there's some stuff in that, well, now we're back to this, and now I'm afraid of things that work, they're not going to be the best, where we have like an hourly rate. These are some books, these are some books that are facing any work within, then that allows a reset, much more so. Okay, so addressing the issues, really, that's like, all right, Donald. If they're re-tweeted on what the court says, this isn't a good advice, what the court says about innovation. You use a part of your teaching to the edge, and so to throw that out, just because things are going well is to say it's not really hard to find a culture. Okay, so being clear about what your culture is. So as we think about this, for both the know and the yes side, if you're focused on psychology, stay tuned, be clear about what the culture is, why it's important, and be about that, as you think about that steps. All right, I'm going to go ahead and put down the mic. Okay. I'm pointing part one day for it. Okay, so my key takeaway from this case, is that idea of balance, right? So being clear about what psychological education is, and that idea between yes, there's some vulnerability, but it requires accountability, and that's for the ends. The ends of learning and performance, so it's not just creating a safe space where everyone feels happy and love is now comfortable. No, it's for that learning, it's for that growth, which requires some of those hard conversations that accountability. And then thinking about it from that broader perspective, that symbolic kind of lens, as you think about the culture, you do want to start at the top and let it ripple down, but it needs to be consistent at all levels, so really bringing that in and being consistent across time as well. So I like this case. I actually left the case better than the reading, in terms of demonstrating the different things that you can do to bring in psychological safety, and someone said, tying it back to the price under leader model, and where you need that balance, right? You need to think about expressing love, honoring agency, inviting accountability, all of those things. And I think Rose, as a secular leader, was a good example of balancing those different areas. All right, so last thing I wanted to talk about today is intellectual honesty. And so this is something that I've been working on with Jeff Dyer. And I think Amy Edmondson would argue that intellectual honesty is part of psych safety. And I think originally it was. And I think over the years it has been locked from that to our idea of what type of organization it is. So we brought up this and told her to give us this idea of intellectual honesty, as voicing ideas of these agreements and Jeff left the second part, in a rational and constructive way. So using data, supporting your ideas, with arguments with data, but really pushing back and offering those different ideas, and making sure that you're making decisions based on the reason, the data, the support for that, not just the person bringing forward the ideas, the ego of that person. And so we've done some work looking at the effects of intellectual honesty, so bringing up these ideas and using data to support your ideas. And so what we did is we looked at innovation at firm level, and we looked at patent citation. So how inventive were different patents, and what we found was that an organization that had more intellectual honesty, they were more likely to be making these really new, novel ideas that others were following as well, kind of setting new directions. We also looked at this in small teams, and we found what was really interesting. So we looked at psychological safety and intellectual honesty and startup teams, and we found that people wanted to stay on the team where they felt like they had psychological safety, but the teams that actually continued were the ones where they had intellectual honesty. And so our argument there is that the intellectual honesty, again, pushes these new ideas that are able to get support and keep going, but people really like the psychological safety. So having both of those is really important. All right, so today we're going to wrap up the sum of reflection time. So thinking about, particularly, Microsoft and some of the things they did, what cost teams can you implement now on your current teams? What do you want to do?"
