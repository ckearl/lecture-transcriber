  "text": "This is another meta-analysis that I looked at. I'm glad I was able to see what are the effects of these different types of justice. And for effects, they look at citizenship behavior, so basically how much you're willing to help other people at work and pitch in and do extra things outside of your job role. And then they look at task performance, so this is your actual job and things that you're trying to do. And again, so these numbers can go from negative 1 to 1, and then over here I have the sample size of the number of people that gave us this information. So first one, the Distributive Justice, again the Outcome Fairness is my field of outcome is fair. They find that that relates a little bit more to performance, like how you're actually doing your job. So if I feel like my Outcome Fair is fair, I'm more likely to do a better job at work. Not a huge relationship, but enough to be significant. Procedural justice, so in terms of whether I feel like I've been treated fairly, but partly processed, had a voice in the process, that relates more to helping, like these extra role behaviors going above and beyond, but it also relates to how well you do your job as well. So involving people in the process, helping them feel heard, has an impact on their work behaviors. And then like I said, the interactional, we divided it out into interpersonal, so helped the relationship between me and my co-workers and my boss, as well as the amount of information that I've provided. And both of these relate more to my willingness to go above and beyond to do these citizenship behaviors to help out and do that kind of thing. Smaller relationship with how I actually do my job. So it kind of shows that these different dimensions of fairness have slightly different effects, that are all affecting how people perform at work. So these are essentially correlations, so showing how much interpersonal justice and helping behaviors how closely they follow each other. So they're not necessarily particularly strong correlations over it. So the point three is a moderate size, and so is the point one nine. When you get down to the point three, it is weaker. Yeah, the still significant across the other. I'd say the fact that that's significant to me is a bigger deal because having worked with my co-workers and trying to improve productivity, even if you're only giving a point to correlation as long as it's a strong correlation, that's still pretty negative. That means essentially if I improve the distributive justice by a little bit, I'm still going to get some returns on it, pretty almost guaranteed. That's like, even though it's not a huge number, the key value is in the club that's here, but I think that's a full meaning. It's good. Even though it's 0.19, I have some of the working operations, and I think it's a bit like that. I have. Is the thought there just like, what down seems to make sense is that there's so many other factors within the board. That's why you look like a relative with small correlations. Yeah, so as you can imagine with task performance, one of the big predictors is your mental ability, like your actual ability to do the job. And this environmental thing has an impact as well, because there's a lot of things that are going to be needed to your process. So show me the importance of it. Now how do you actually do this? So you guys have the fair process are able to read for today. So I'll have some from you. So what does it pull out of a fair process? So what does it pull out of a fair process? I don't know. This is the part of something that you can read. I don't know what the most of these things are. All right, so come back to your presentation. All right, reading. Do you want to run a jump in on the reading? All right, so. I'll go with the reading. And don't we really appreciate how there's a way to have enough chemistry? Oh yeah. So I think because she didn't feel this is too much of a judge, she was actually still kind of pissed. I think that's really illistered in that, like, people want to feel awkward and feel like they're like a part of the process when they don't feel like they didn't have an impact on it. It really can mess with someone's mental. Well, and it shows that distinction between the distributive and the perceived ill justice, right? She got the outcome she wanted, that's why she was there, but because she wasn't part of the process, they created this frustration. I totally agree with this, Ellen. I, the several of those both of us were just talking about it as your perceived version of justice, right? It's, I think, the exact same thing where it's like, okay, yeah, I got the outcome, but I kind of don't care about that because it's my will to be part of the standing. It still wasn't a job, I'm here, right? I have to ask this to be a good example of the same. At a great point as a leader, right, is you have to understand the perception going back to the symbolic frame, like what kind of meaning are you creating for people, what kind of opportunities for those perceptions? Artists is important to have the outcome. One story that at least it out to me was when you were using the equipment plants that they wanted to implement some sort of process, and the plant manager was well-liked, and so they did a lot of, like, review work and decided to quickly implement something while forgetting that it took them months to figure out what they wanted to do, but do at this whole time get it tough to anyone after the plant. So they just assumed that we didn't get this out fast, and then everything will be fine. But for getting that, as people, we also need time to make a change, and so because they need just to be so fast that, considering what they thought or what was going on in the mind as they were doing all secretive work, they have the plan of that. They were probably freaking out, and not wanting to change that all anymore. Yeah, so thinking we're going to save them time, right? We're not going to call on our employees to be involved with us, we're going to save their resources, but then, then, going up into the process. I didn't show them that I think 150 was the importance of, like, how many systems are there in this? I think that way is like a big impact, as well, and we're going to be able to explain things that I actually, like, from my mom, I know there's a lot of care in things, but I think I've seen that on to my mom, and she's great about it, she helped me explain the control of why things were done in certain ways. And I think, pushing back at previous boxes is like, so you have to do this, and there's really no explanation, even though it might be really interesting, it can help me to make the bigger picture of what it makes the tax of different boxes. Okay, so you guys are getting exactly on the points of this article, right? So, kind of the Tiffany's point, this idea of engagement, so getting people involved in allowing them to present their viewpoints, what they know, how it could impact a, and then the explanation, right? So, providing clear reasons for why you're doing the things that you're doing. So, setting those as well. What's, yeah, here. Is this explanation following your actual distance? Yes, yeah, and it would fit well with the informational. So, most of these are going to, well, the explanations that's with informational engagement, that's with more of the process. I mean, they're all related to process, but, I don't know, I'm not going to be part of that. Okay, what's the third one that we're missing up here? We've got engagement and explanation. Okay, what's this expectation? Just, we're talking a lot about changes in our heating changes, so how are you going to expect a different form? If it's different than before, or what are the punishments that you build to perform, basically rules of the game, if they change the rules? Exactly. So, what are the rules of the game? How will people be rewarded or evaluated? So, we're putting it in a new system. We want to make it clear how that's going to work. So, all three of these go towards our process and trying to make sure that people know what's happening, why it's happening, and what's expected of them. So, there we have it. The other thing I wanted to cover before we jumped into the similar case is theory X and theory Y. So, the color clock got this a little bit, and they currently get to motivation. But, as a leader, you're going to have an underlying assumption of what makes people work. Like, what makes them take? So, theory X is more authoritarian. This is more about the carrots and sticks, right? So, if I provide the right words, or if I provide the right punishment, that's what's going to get people to work. Because they're inherently lazy, and I just have to figure out their incentives. And if I can figure out their incentives, then I can get them to work. And so, in this case, theory X, a manager is very much in control, creating the situation that those carrots and sticks to get employees to do what they need them to do. Is theory X and Y kind of on a spectrum, or is it just a blocking line? I've always thought of it as blocking weight. Do you have an argument for it being on a spectrum? I mean, I can't imagine many places would be either one or the other, right? People that you're managing might be leaning one side with the other, different environments in terms of job types. I think would lend to different parts of those theories. That's why I can't imagine that. I would be, oh, just theory X or just theory Y. Yeah, maybe that does get into, you know, we often be about incentives, whether you're theory X or theory Y. I just think theory X is much more like carrots and sticks, and that's primarily what you focus on. Versus theory Y, which is just an assumption that employees want to learn. So, I guess I could see how kind of combine the two of them, but I think one side is probably going to be more dominant to the other. It depends on your assumptions of employees too. I have seen in my former work that maybe I work in a factory. And for the employees who depends on the union, many have a vision more like theory X. Yes. And for the management, even the middle management, more participative. This is a mix that I have seen. Yes, and I think that's very common. And I think the question is, you know, we often see theory X especially in manufacturing settings thinking about the more employees. Could you apply theory Y? But yes, I think that's definitely a good way of thinking. I was going to add to that of like some settings of the theory X works best in some other settings. Theory Y works best in the middle. But you can't expect all your soldiers to be like, you know, I won't give you good how this place should run all that. You can clearly clear leader of how the vision of employees is something that can be done in some settings. So I want to push back a little bit there and clarify. So theory Y is not necessarily like always having employees contribute suggestions and being part of like the vision setting process. But it goes to this assumption. So theory Y's assumption is employees want to be challenged. They're people that can grow and develop. And so your job as a leader is to provide the situation for them to be challenged and to try and meet those or goals. First is theory X is assumption that they're passive and lazy and I just I need to push them in order to get the work done. And so I think even in the military you could take a theory X or a theory Y perspective. I guess I have read stuff by Dr. Boehm. Really? Yeah. And he very much is a theory Y kind of assumption person that people want to be challenged so you have to trust them to push them up. So I see the point of thinking about the situation. Obviously the congruent model you have to have your people in your work matching up. But I think you could use theory X or a theory Y. So is theory X and theory Y like are those common terms used throughout for this thing or is it kind of like in this situation today we're using this term for like a four term. So they're general. They're more general especially as you get into motivation and theories of motivation. They're actually theory Y. And we'll hear like we're going to do the same sort of thing. I kind of think about like in high school I remember taking like a regular level physics class and it wasn't like honors or whatever. And I think a lot of the way students do take those honors classes. But that like compared to like an honors chemistry class the standards of like expectations are so different. And even like the classroom management style is super different. Like if you know you need help on an assignment or you want to redo something the honors like the honors teachers are way more like. Oh yeah like you want to learn not because like you were lazy at the get go and you realize you're like about to fail. And so like the expectations but also the way they handle their classroom is so different. I took that one physics class. I never took like a regular level class again because I was like this is crazy because it's it's madhouse because a lot of kids don't want to be there. They don't care and they're super disrespectful. So like kind of has to be this like you have to listen to me and this is what's happening and you know whatever. So I just think that's a great example. And a nice way of doing this analogy of the assumptions that people are coming in with. So in that case the assumptions teachers are coming in with like they hear because they have to be here versus they hear because they want to learn. And then they're supposed to mix. All right well let's comment and then we're going to jump into it. I also think that in that scenario like you come down to kind of the situation I feel like. But I also think that something that comes down to the manager and like they're stuck in their own confidence in themselves and how do you control which is something that was mentioned in the reading. Because I remember in sales that you get very different managers like they both were successful and there were reps. But one of them comes in and then they're controlling their micromania and they work. They're like you have these minute reports and then day for all your metrics and then you have the other ones that are more of the why. They're like let me inspire you like we're team you know work together we want all to succeed so we can all put them in the mirror. It's just really interesting but it comes down I think a lot to personality and it's a good use to. Yeah that's a good question. I'm going to go into the situation of who is the manager what is their assumption there's things going to drive those assumptions. All right now let's do this in action with our friend or part of someone. That was about that. All right so let's go search 2-3. So tell us about old Ricardo and by all that mean for us, actually younger. Okay. Okay. So I was holding up. Hold your car and I was in younger part of it. I was in the middle of it and I thought it was a test. And I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. I was trying to run in the same way. So I was saying you... You expected the same from the ordinary, the ordinary. So I don't know. I want to say like we run healthy. But you have to do a bit less than that. So I want to say that this is a funny part of the verbal thing. I want to be in self-possessed, unparalleled, and pleased. I want to be in that. Then you want to be in that. I want to be in that. Okay, so high levels of stress. I think this is something. And so, when this all happened, you kind of made this rocker How many wives success in this model? Within the properhood, the profitability though, it said that the environment was suffering a lot. There was a lot of hope, cancer, employees against each other, it's surprising that they were profitable, but I think they're just so sorry. Again, his control freak, he doesn't have a healthy lifestyle, but he's kind of like expecting other people to be like him. He doesn't like what's the word for it. He has a very hard on himself and he has similar expectations. And even though that's a few double works, he has a lot of work that's been done by the family, the company, the company, which leads to efficiency at work, which means even though you have enough work for it, but they're not hitting the goals, they're not hitting the liveries and all that. And he's putting in new rules on everybody and everybody's compelled to do it, and it's not like any other employee has to say or anything. Okay, so compel the powerful word there, what the environment is like, charming and then juicy. And seeing him as a director, he wanted to join the company in a job and fired 50% of his father's executives and was there reason why he became profitable? Okay, so the customer environment, firing people, getting in there really fast, do you need? Short-term profitability, I feel like we'll get him maximized our capacity and burn out of people. Not thinking about long-term longevity. All right, so short-term profitability. Yeah. I think you also lost a little bit of respect. I think one of the maybe good things about authoritarian is that it should cultivate that respect, but someone went and drew a grim reaper on one of their flip sheets and everything, so they didn't really respect what was going on and they didn't change. Okay, essentially we could say he's not respected. Going back with this idea of compelling people to do what you think. All right, so let's talk a little bit. Well, okay, so old Ricardo, if you have to say, 3X3Y, pretty clear. So next. Yes. All right, now let's go to new Ricardo, a little bit older. Okay, lately, tell us about new Ricardo. New Ricardo was a much more relaxed person and leader, so except that we did not authoritative as almost as far away as you could possibly get from the authoritarian. It was very as of a separate, it could be the right word, but almost a crappy leadership style where he provided a lot of people to participate and the employees were a lot more in charge of what happened than he could have had ideas and tried them. Okay, so using that participative leadership style, okay. Overall, you adopted a democratic philosophy, right? Which applies in other parts of the principle. Okay, so expecting people to participate to be part of the decision-making proceed, yeah, I think there was also kind of this implicit link along with the way I just said. I think that he was the one who left the alone that they would make wise decisions. Like, there was, like he wasn't even focused on, like I knew he were the one who talked about like, just day, I was just sitting on my account and I was like, you know, he's like, you better not leave him here. Like, he just trusted them enough and I think with that, probably was himself a philanthropist in a way. Like, they felt trusted and they were working with Bernie. So I'm adding demonstrated them here because of the actions that went along with the saying that they trusted. Aaron and then people. So one thing, they talk about is, what we've had earlier on this through Wipeup, assuming pointy want to be challenged so they help them to develop more new skill, post training, then making sure they're good to do different programs, which is great. How then do you stay engaged to be more of a public company? Okay, so assume desire to learn. What you guys are pointed out, it used to be takers like cross training, right? Certainly people through giving us different opportunities. He quit controls in the server lanes, there's gold and other stuff. And even, and doing so, he saved money, for example, in the human resources department. Okay. Which is an interesting thing, right? So less control, you're a bit of HR. Excuse me. I'm saying that. Okay. I definitely, that's true. Okay. What is it that you think you're free as an HR? Maybe. I mean, what is it like to be a HR and then just be a two? Yeah, like getting you really ready for this. Hi. I'm a regular. I'm a regular. Oh, wasn't it? I'm a huge person. I'm a regular. I'm a regular. I'm a regular. I'm a regular. I'm a regular. I'm a regular. So the functions are still there. Is this not in a separate department? Well, even like redistributing that over further, that even up on something on salary, that was really both new. But I thought that it was, he's still doing the same context that HR would have where they, they were very, the financial information the company was really transparent. So they had like the ability to make a reasonable, like, what I could be paid based on an understanding about the competition deal. Okay, so a lot more transparency. But I think I noticed a lot of hiring around managers, they actually like would be the performance of their own managers too, which was really interesting and different than a lot of people. Usually it's one sign that in this case, it's always a collaborating together. Okay. Okay. Much more open for the forum's reviews. Kind of long thought. I was really surprised during the last let's down the side of things, rather than playing off people. Like, all right, we're just going to like have everybody be like, we do spectrary percent. And apparently, like everyone is doing that. Okay, so, press the board. The third has. So, it's interesting, again, going along with that idea is a democratic, right, that we're just going to make these across the board. Yeah. Yeah. He also engaged the employees on a read decision making process, letting them decide which office they would have stayed, what that would have been. And then, the other thing that I'm going to say is, he built that E1-5s and brought some people in the office, he's also making a position for them to work with their federal partners. Okay. So, engaging them in the decision making process, hearing their voice, even if it's at least in the short term, these needs to gain financially. All right. I find it very interesting that in just a position with previous reading of their process about the manufacturing cells, and this one, the police from up to the idea of the manufacturing cells, and implemented it themselves. And so, I'm very interested to see that economy up. Apparently, the employees are made even during out-and-side voice-to-increasing themselves, and doing their own research and hearing their own things and their own suggestions. It's interesting that Justin O. is expecting the leadership to make those. Okay. So, I'm thinking about where that decision making power lays, and what will be the employee's experience. Yeah. I thought he was like transparent in that, like, this very innovative process, and I don't know if I agree with all this process, but because he had, like, principles that he was really clear about, they would, like, try new things, and people understood why they were trying things. And if it didn't work, they would change a little bit or shift. Again, I don't know if I agree with everything that they did, but because he was clear about it, people were less upset. Okay. So, that transparency, providing explanations, putting it all out there, made for a different environment, okay? I feel like we haven't really touched on exploratory, to make the site that I'm willing to have, you know, employees make suggestions. He also decided, what if this work in education? Try different settings. Yeah. No. All right. I feel like the party that was flat, something like that, it's like, oh, it turned into this great person, the more of us, he's leveraging rather than forcing. So, like, hold, he was forcing, like, oh, you're gonna do my way. He's leveraging people's self-interest. And so, like, if all these processes ended up making the company for, like, for the drop of profits, I'm sure he probably still would shift again. By leveraging individual strengths and desires for employees to step up, that's what allowed people to know more comfortable than you for a company to step up. Okay. So, still trying to get the most out of your employees, just a different approach to leveraging versus compelling. Sort of, then that makes sense. So, I guess, looking at this, I feel like there's, like, clear, like, oh, like, theory-wise, like, better than theory-X. But it also feels like to me that part of it is, like, the combination. And, like, you can see the same pattern in, like, the military. I'll send people to base camp, and they get this, like, theory-X lifestyle, but then coming out of it, they get more of the theory-wise, or, like, even in this program, like, we get our hard, first, second semester. And then we get, to make choices again. Like, this is something that makes part of it. Hell, versus leverage. It's part of it, like, your dissonant, like, the weakening of that makes theory, like, more effective, or is it just that, like, the underlying cost of the board is always going to be good. I mean, I think it goes back to what we were talking about before we jumped into the decades, right? So, thinking about the situation, the people that you have, what you're trying to accomplish, the managers that you have, and the assumptions that they hold, yes, they're can be an interplay between them. I think in presenting them to you guys, my goal is that you identify, like, which assumptions you're offering under, and what it's likely to lead to. So, can you be an effective theory ex-manager? I think you can. But, kind of as you pointed out, is it a transition where, you know, you start with a theory ex mentality with the assumption that you are going to get to a theory-wise, where you want to see your people grow and explore their own ideas? I think that that makes sense as well, but you know, we could debate that too. I thought it was interesting how, at first I kind of got the sense that they weren't holding too much accountability in place, but then as they were doing the new miscellaries, or doing things they checked in with people, there's a few people that were outrageous with that stuff, so they kind of bring that in. And then also they had a manager with the people giving their own manager reviews that was just doing awful, so they found a different role for them to get sales. They were kind of having that accountability, and I also thought it was interesting with how they did not, like, people pushed back on some of this stuff. I think they were like, I want to prove that I'm not the person who stole this, or this piece did go missing, but he's just like, no, we're not going to focus on what's going wrong, we're focusing on trusted people who are kind of bored, so you don't want to sense somebody that we don't trust to. That's a great point, the accountability is a big part of this, and making sure that it succeeds. To Stuart's point, I've been thinking of like this talk over and things like that, and thinking in some ways like, who can't maybe be a little different than people want to expect. The day clear, it isn't the very clear, like, you're going to come to your talk, can't you? But I think it's probably easier to talk about what you can actually build a culture of theory behind, and you have that trust that when all of a sudden something happened, then, as a leader, you might need to kind of shift into more of this theory acts, like, people understand it, and they're like, you probably catch their attention, because it's not normal, but which is probably good, right? Like, you probably talk about a huge hand, but we're only getting it. I think he probably would even argue, like, he had moments where he really instilled theory why, but I thought he was going to find a moment where he needed to be, like, or under attack, or something's happening, and, like, that's how the window, like, listen, do what I say right now, because there's some light on the window. So, anyway, I just did not light on the window, business, but I think if you kind of create that trust culture of theory, why it makes it easier to talk about when needed. And I think this is a really great point, and it leads us to what I wanted to do next. How do you actually put this into play and the organization that you've been in? So, I want you to get into groups of three or four, doesn't have to do your core type. And one of you choose an organization that you've worked for, and think about how you could put in a theory why, a way of managing, and what it would require, what it would look like, what it would be active, what it would do. Why are you being effective? How would you put three why, and what it would be like? So, go ahead, groups of three or four people, 10-ish people."
