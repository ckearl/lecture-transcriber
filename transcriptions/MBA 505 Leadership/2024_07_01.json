  "text": "or your team to reflect on where they're at and then some individual reflection time as well as the end. All right, so stage is approved development. It must come in framework. It is probably all to be the support. So the forming, storming, norming, performing, and injuring framework. So five stages of approved development. Anyone familiar with this? Many of you. OK, so what's forming? It's coming together. OK, coming together, how do people usually interact when they're forming? Very simple. Very simple. I don't even think so. Exactly. Light, all smiles, right? Trying to put your best foot forward. OK, what about storming? What happens with the storming phase? Jacob, like, floating nose. OK, running heads. Some conflict starts to arise. You're recognizing that you might have different goals. You're an objective, different skills. OK, what happens with the storming phase? OK, you get over it a bit. How do you get over it? Exactly. Your goals are kind of assigned or established. OK, so your goals get clarified about these guys' teams' lives. OK, expectations. Expectations get set. You can clearly see what you're going to do. I just need to say, any company is normalizing. You're making everything clear. It's all, this is what our actual routine is going to be. OK, getting more into that, we're receiving setting those expectations, following those expectations, and starting kind of gel that way. All right, what about the performing stage? They're more done. OK, you're getting work done. And it has a sad face and a happy face, because sometimes performance can go well. You can be effective. Sometimes it can be ineffective, which is a reminder, norming, like, setting expectations and roles, doesn't necessarily mean that's going to lead to good performance, particularly if you're not enabling people to use their skills, you're creating norms that we don't speak up. Right, you can create ineffective norms. So be mindful of that. All right, this last one, adjourning, Erin. Had to say goodbye. Yes. We're glad. We're glad. So we've got a point in the summer where you will adjourn for new themes and brief starts. So hopefully that is a sad moment when you're letting up. I'm working on group settings. The story doesn't normally go to the garden. I'm sure like after performing, I'll do a discovery differences. You're fully sure you're opening and discovery differences. Hey, Sylvan, I appreciate you, but I don't appreciate you. So. OK, and that's a great point that you can, you know, you have to go through this process, you perform a little bit, and then you might restart again. So you can go back through the process. Yeah, they're here. All right, so this model is useful. It's one of the most studied models. But as the authors in the next article pointed out, it does have some flaws. So they came up with their dynamic team development model. So why do we need this dynamic model here? Because the products like stages to be development, you're going to have like this micro-bapt. Smallly certain. You're going to have a lot of beauty and lot of launches. Because you have the same people with different model projects. Yeah. So we're going to perform different times. They're going to be developing again. They're going to reset everything. And it's a little more so. So I can show you. OK, so I'm hoping to see more on that launching, because you're often going to be regrouping starting again. I like how it captures the dynamics between leering through for maybe like what an ideal should be. It's like the other one. It might be surfaces that have like emotions in the actions like we've improved development. But for me as a leader, I think you can do it. What should I be doing at your stage in this group project actually? So much more focused on the leader, the role of the leader, Anna and then Jen. I really appreciate being evaluated for Jen. Because that really is the understanding of well-known and it's like everything is going beyond the results of the project. I'm going to do some different things. Yeah, providing that information. So when you start the new group, as Carla says, like you have that information and you can want to do a little bit better. I said that the process took really kind of a long time. It's not linear. But you have to do like three gray, then repeat your goals, seeing how you perform it. Exactly. Recognizing those feedback loops and going back to the progress. Great point. The forming, storing model is more observational. Like you could watch a lot of teams, much just an observation of how teams normally went through the process. This is more only an argument. How are your team there functioning? More is the internet, just a little bit more. Yeah, that's great. So this model is much more productive. So what leaders can do and the different points that they can step in and make those investments down the chain? Yeah, I was just going to add to that. We're kind of like how it feels more observational for the other format. Also, this shows more like what the other format helps work this. This is how it works between that. This is a little bit more like a point of the senior. Or this is much more like a internship when it's actually developing a team. And not just having a team going to a project that actually guiding it, essentially, and leaving it participating on this team. Yeah, which is one of the biggest differences. So this model is designed for team where there is a clear leader who can lead a guy. Jamie. I thought I was also interested in this model. I'm accounted for team members knowing each other before getting on the team. And one sort of assumed that you'd never seen each other before in your life. And then you showed about a team where this was like a work at the same place. You kind of know that person's reputation. And you may have worked that before. Next semester, we'll have general idea of who's to get on our team from the group this semester. That's a great point. And again, it kind of goes to how these models were developed. So the five stages was very magic, studying undergrad teams, and a behavioral lab who didn't have heart contacts, didn't have a leader, and with that more observational. Versus this approach is Weber and Weber are essentially consultants who go in and diagnose the point of the team and makes suggestions. Yeah, so a great point. So in order to apply this model, you want to have a leader. And then the other part is, as you would expect with work teams, you need to have a plan and objective. Something that they're trying to achieve makes this model more effective. All right, so both of these models can provide insights and information into how a team is doing and what you can do to correct it. So let's go ahead and dive into our piece today. And I'm going to go ahead and flip this up. All right, Lily, I'm coming to you for our comeback here. So what are the criticisms? I think just for the process, just in general. Great. Well, Monroe didn't feel like they fully captured the overarching issues within the chapter. All of them were focusing on smaller issues rather than chapter-wide. So the reason they're focusing on overarching issues is because they won. Other criticisms that have this process? I mean, something I thought was just more like the people who are coming to evaluate, they didn't want to upset any managers. So they weren't necessarily feel free to be making comments on the topic of issues. So advisors don't want to upset the chapter managers. What's your shift? Good. You can do it. Again, opinion-wise, I think the way they set it up, they're kind of created a weird territory because they didn't know each advisor had their territory and they were very afraid to stray from that. So advisors staying in their areas? Which good and bad, but. OK. So you said, you're not bad. What's the bad part of staying in their areas? They don't have the freedom to look at the overall picture and kind of cohesively come up with some issues. Correct. Again. Looking overall, somewhat going on. Any other criticisms that come back else? It says they're all very experienced in leadership and stuff but it seemed like they don't really have great fighting skills. So they would participate in that, and they're all together. Like, issues are very similar, but they do want to end up on their own board. OK. Not putting in writing. Erqual analysis of that part. For me? Yeah. I was saying that even for every analysis, it seems that they were kind of assessing your coming up with. Nothing was super actionable. This is where he used the issue. Yeah, they were really getting guidance to see how they should and really be as prepared as they were. OK. So not giving useful guidance. I feel like for the advisors, just reading through the history of how to give about their responsibilities. I personally feel like they're kind of being overworked. But you just have so many things on your plate. And at least in the beginning, advisors weren't necessarily given the increase in pain. Right? Or just adding to their own responsibilities. And then it's just becoming more and more and more. OK. So overworked. This is an additional thing for them, too. I feel like I was reading in Miller. She was trying to get more creativity and more kind of them applying their own experience. But it kind of was falling all under the red crust. The color is molded with their analysis. She was more out of the box. So flattening creativity following just that mold? I was going to say somewhere like that. It's like almost like they're so structured that there's no room for creativity. Because you give them a guideline. And they basically do put them in a box. So like in that, that's why they're also scared to go outside of the box, because you gave them that structure. And the other thing is the olden's operations measures. Like because you've got a considerable work to make there not be so creative in the end, not to know all this. They're taking on analysis. And we're doing all these extra stuff that you shouldn't necessarily be what they're doing. OK. So it's a program. So Monroe, what's her official program partner officer? She's doing all the analysis as well when it should be all the advisors, but they're over with you. Yeah. OK. Do it too much. OK. So a lot of great points in that. Even though a lot of people are doing all the work. Yeah. It's just a lot of information, right? It's particularly both on the side of the specific chapters. I'm not necessarily wanting to take feedback, but even when they do, it's not exactly the same point. It will follow according to the plan that these providers have. OK. So probably the implementation, so a little change essentially. Yeah. I also feel like there's an issue where they're overworked. And then they're also not experienced enough in the CEPs where with the CEP, they want very specific things. They want a very specific type of writing. They have this guy's book that has so many different things as specific as how they want it. But then they only get this one. I think it's like an orientation week of a strain. They might then go a year, maybe a little bit longer until they actually do it. And so then they lose that training. And then there's only so much that they can really get retrained on during this whole process. And so then anyone that would put up with people who are trying to revert everything while also trying to help us out of the group out and advise. And so it becomes an issue where by only doing it once per year, you have a lot of people who are basically having to restart everything and not know exactly how they're doing it. And so then they end up having to focus on the how instead of on the group's goal. And it makes us out there to focus on just how to end it in the proofread instead of what is the actual orientation, how does this chapter actually improve. And so just I feel like they need one person who on each team who does it to a three times a year to have more of that experience to help you work that mentoring. And that guy knew this is how you write it up. So that the program officer can focus more on that. Okay, so really great point to hear in terms of how they are trained and this idea of lost learning, right? Which is going to be about focusing on the process, like following the instructions rather than the content. I thought it was really interesting. I mentioned a couple of times that the writers, when she checked in them, one of them actually did recognize some of these overarching problems. So it's like they have to keep the ability to do that. But it seems like there's maybe like a lack of like vision that shares the possibility that they feel to share those things. Okay, because they like choose to stay quiet. They choose to stay in early even though they like they do, they have identified. Okay. So staying in their lane, rather than looking at it holistically, suggesting that lack of sure just comes to a great idea. All right, lots of hands. Let's go to unit. I think that's just all in the magic of a two rigid structure and God leadership. You have something that's so rigid that isn't really give the person in charge to go outside the box and you have the individual providers, you know, not going to be going, going back to the structure and then, you know, we're micens reading it like it didn't do like that. But the leaders got comfortable kind of deviating from the existing path. Okay, I want to dig a little bit deeper on these two elements of the structure and the leadership. So when we think about the structure, what is the current structure for these chapter leadership programs? Okay. So we have this pool of advisors that we can draw from. Things have one thing up that's an optional program. Okay. So they're invited to come to these. So it's an optional review. So these chapters and set that broader scheme. Sorry. I can even just to teach the those advisors 13. Is there. Our program about leaving out the number of outdoor programs. Programrup us. I will put the structure prayer. I already mentioned that the room is missing. possible. possibilities for techniques of chakka you're not necessarily every. permulverable faculty contracts. Okay. But the talkely, identified things that we can pull back. Yeah. That's what I have to say. You have like a 16 week project and then there's a few weeks where the program officers kind of putting their port together. Okay. You're really good-minded, tied line. I think if I remember correctly they had an objective. So if you volunteer to do that they have specific things you want to solve. So actually limited the scope. And so I think that's why you have all the previous systems on the way. So limited scope. And how did they limit the scope? Where did that come from? I think my partner in the handbook, they had detailed specific questions like any group you were specifically subject to. It might have been linked to who actually asked for. Yeah. So it was limited from the preliminary information and that first conference call, right? So from beginning. Okay. Brad. Each advisor had at least five years of red cross experience and they all participated in a training organization or orientation. I mean training or orientation program. Okay. So they have experience and at least that orientation. Well, it taught them to make sure to have attention. So they have two different objects. Whether they have like the operation we use where they want to actually shape things when the chapter is actually failing to live up to their quality. And then they all sound to see pieces where they need to improve things because they want to develop and become better and more efficient. So kind of what's the important distinction there? The other one is the matter of improving quality because they have the opportunity and the other one is more about when they have performance issues where they are not performing according to the standards of the right cloth. Okay. So we're going to focus here on the opportunities, right? So these are not the prices situations but more of an opportunity to change. Okay. As part of the, this is related to the 16-week project but most of it's done not on sites and off sites. It's only one week for their actually all the advisors and that team are with each other and with the people they're viewing. Okay. So only one week together. I want to catch the wounded skills you can see. It's not like unless it's a small game or a problem is going to be a game from their range but it's passed through the whole. I'm not really reporting problems or up to these outside of the system. Okay. So studying individual length. I thought you just find this on. And I think with that only one week together this is a brand new team. So we're not having a staffer get a staffer from site to site where forming a new team. And they have some meetings that we get them one week together. So I think they're like early and there's even more major processing for my role staffer. Okay. New team each time. Bring your own cost to it. Okay. So you've identified some of the structural things going on. This handbook we know is highly formalized. So we don't technically get much into the structure of parts of organizations. But having a very specific handbook with this big timeline, the unique modules highly formalized. Right. You have everything written in detail. And the other goal here is that it is to standardize the report. Right. Because what problem is a handbook from edge to solve? Too much variance. Right. So there was too much variance in these reports. So we develop this handbook and we tell everyone to follow it. The kind of shows, again, that tension of guys like too much guidance, not an opportunity. Okay. So the structure is a big part of this. You also identify leadership as part of the problem. So how would leadership part of the problem? Historically, the product or the program officer was really more of white as secretary. And frankly, that's kind of what it still sounds like. They take it on a couple more roles. I'm going to put the slide in. Maybe you guys have some group discussions. But they haven't really strictly defined the product officer as someone who's like read the vision. It really helps the team figure out what's going on here. And let's actually go with creative solutions. Their role isn't defined enough in that way. Okay. So we can say we're essentially no leader. Some confusion about that. Yeah, it seems like it's a little different. Like reactive and pro-activity. Like, all the teams, all the buyers go out and do their thing and then bring it back. And then at least one row is kind of like taking it and wondering. Maybe this isn't as effective. Where is it she would have started in the beginning? Here's our criteria. I think those are what she looked for. Did she find that results? Okay, more of that sorting and parole than did you have time? I was just going to say some other things. The program officer, I think it's been mentioned before, she's been taking on a lot and having to, I think most of what's already been said. But she has to coach the advisors and a lot of different things. It's almost like it needs to be split into two different roles between one that's supporting them, like on-site, with their things and then the other kind of roles. Like, yeah, absolutely. Okay, so kind of underlying what I'm hearing you say in some ways, and this is kind of this idea of the program officer and secondary unit, is to focus on logistics potentially? Yeah, there's kind of a split between two different things that she has to spend her time on. Yeah. So just experiences? Versus supporting the advisors, holding them. Like, I think that mentioned her case, she had to like, practically go out to a couple of them where she thought they were going to be efficient in some areas, to try to get the info that they needed, kind of be there to help support them. Okay, great point. All right, page in. I think it kind of, when we look at some of the criticisms, when we, she's taking on all these things, like rewriting and kind of voicing their opinions for them, I think maybe in her mind she thinks that, hey, I'm doing a great thing, I'm helping out, but she's removing the empowerment piece of leadership that, like, hey, you have, you know, like the lack of vision is like, they have these thoughts, they have these, like, innate in them, right? Because they've got experience of thing, all these things, but, but she's just taking it on, thinking she's removing the burden or just doing it herself, but instead, she's like diminishing their work, because she's just doing it. Yeah. Okay, so not empowering them, because she's just doing it for the purpose of the read, those are part of the scene. Yeah, I think, I think going along with that, she's like, terribly, well, she did, and then she feels like she has to support them, because she can't just tell me what you need to cover this. Okay, so I'm gonna say she's following the rules, right? Like, saying it or not. She has, like, an expectation for, like, analysis, but I don't know if that's clear to the advisors, because she's like, wow, they don't, like, they're really weak in this, but there's nothing that says, like, she coached them to that or, you know, kind of taught them how to do that, because that's something that can be taught. Okay, so our expectations regarding analysis share. Alright, so I thought about how this was kind of, she was seeing about the advisors, and I kind of wanted to tell you a set of situations to your advisors. If she's thinking that, you know, all of these reports we believe are, they were, like, the official reports, I wonder, like, did you really tell your expectations, and are you enforcing, like, accountability to your advisors? Because, like, and then she had to overcompensate for their deficiencies, so it's like how she's overworked. Okay, so not having clear expectations, and then not enforcing accountability. So I wanted to take a little bit deeper on this idea of the expectations, because, couldn't you say that the handbook literally set down expectation? And I kind of like, we were competing expectations, because the handbook is like, this is exactly what we want you to do, but then, then I was like, I want more creativity, I want more thinking outside the box, and those are very, other opposite expectations. Yeah. And so, which one of them is she communicated with the edge of that, because it's a kind of experience. I can't vote in the environment that's very right now. Okay, so we've competing expectations of standardization, which we create through our handbook, versus expecting, she says creativity. So, just something else. Well, I just kind of want to push back on this a little bit. I don't think standardization completely if the limits create creativity. I think what she's actually asking for is she's asking them not to be doing out the standardized process. And so, I think, like, there's that same I've created to be loves and stringed, right? Yes. So, I think what she's actually saying is she doesn't want them to just go through the process and then she wants them to look at the process with different eyes every single time. Okay. So, how can you take both of these and create something? All right. What I would like to do next is bring us back to the frames that we talked about last week. So, as we think about solutions, I'm putting them up on the back here. So, the structural HR political and symbolic. So, what I'd like to do is how do you guys get into groups based on your frame? And I want you to come up with a solution. So, those of you that were higher on the structural frame, gather over here. Those of you that are higher on the HR frame gather over here. And the political symbolic, you guys are going to need to find your stripes. They actually make the recommendation and it's actively going to change. Okay. So, what is the proposed solution then? To find authority. Okay. To find authority. So, who do you want to give authority to? I haven't said consult. There were kind of two things. It's like, you either give authority to a program manager. And they kind of run it or you have a structured team that goes from consultant to consultant. Like, as they go about, they have a dedicated team to it. Okay. So, more authority to the program officer or someone that's going to know. The box office. Okay. The P.O. The whole account of it. Okay. They are. They are. I don't know. All right. symbolic frame. What did you guys come up with? What's your solution? Well, so, you said you had like 16 whip project. You would like to divide it like seven smaller ones or six smaller ones to work on a giant cycle. So, you're going to get more freement, you gather the people, define ideas. There's one problem which is so much time. And it will break them by own vices on trying their everything. So, you can make sense what's wrong, but it's working. And then you can do that. Okay. What message are you sending by changing the process? Yeah. You are choosing one problem which is over the time. Instead of turning something open. I'm not so sure about this solution. How many more? Well, the idea that we talked about is not my personal and now I want people to go. I don't love that it's fully optional, volunteer. When does that happen? You said someone was like, hey, things come on, today, but you suck. You know, you don't do that. You don't give them any feedback to volunteers. They give you the example for their time. And so, we talked about, even if there was just a couple of people as part of the group, that were almost like not volunteers, or like full-time working in that. Like, you know, it's like the Red Cross event, or something like that. They just kind of go out and like, this is great. Red Cross event. Yeah, like a task board that's actually trained, and then you can still have some volunteers. But like, I mean, we've all been to different volunteer things. If everyone's volunteering, everyone's there for their three hours. Like, no one really is kind of like, hey, how can I help? But if you have at least a few people and know what they're doing, it's like, I'm glad you're all here. You do this. Now, you do this, and like, you're doing what we're going to do. And then those people are actually being evaluated. Because that's what they do. And then they're being better at it over the next day. You like, are you used to ventures as a symbol bear? Yes. Exactly. It is like a consulting team, though. More visual. But they were masks in case you had a headache. But they make PowerPoint slides. Yeah. Okay. I was going to talk a lot like actually, and we should do a training for the leadership about like the leadership process. It was quite interesting about getting about the model, the new one, the new one. And so that they actually can take more focus on the launching and collaborating before they actually start and like doing that process. Okay. So I'm going to summarize that as you want a leader to be, right? And variety gives their ways of going about that. Okay. Excellent. And yes, having the day, the red cross-abenders, like thinking about the message. Yes. That's what you want to be thinking about here. All right. HR friends, what did you guys come up with? What are your suggestions? We had a couple of different groups. Our group, Izzy, said we're forgetting about the customer. That's kind of a theme. So we want to switch the process a little bit to be more customer. And it needs base. So instead of a standardized systematic approach, maybe move the interviews up earlier in the process, use the handbook as a repository of resources, depending on what threads you want to pull, and what problems you're actually seeing. And then you're delivering a more customized service to the people that actually pass for this. Okay. So focusing on those chapter needs, doing their first. So what we talked about was like in front of a kickoff meeting, to set expectations, and then also kind of taking it from the HR perspective of like motivation, the feelings of these people that some of that stood out to me was it feels like they're not giving clear feedback, and novel feedback, because they want to be nice. They don't want to rock the boat. They're probably in the red cross because they want to help people. They want to be nice on that, but just connect that. You're volunteering on this group to help out the red cross, do its mission, and really help people. The best way to do that is to be clear, is to give us our feedback if you need tears, to talk about downsizing, is to talk about creative ideas, and kind of help the team members who are already volunteering connect that the best way you can serve, which you're already trying to do by volunteering, is to deliver feedback in this way and ideas in this way, and help them feel safe doing that. So something that came to me as you were saying, the distinction between kind and nice, so emphasizing that they need to be kind, and not nice. Yeah, it's the way it goes to help people in the red cross not to make sure one at the red cross organization doesn't feel sad for you. Which is the greatest distinction, because oftentimes I think HR is that idea of focusing on people's feelings, lose us that edge of knowing you actually need to look at what they need. So it's not just feel like the need, it's a great, great, doesn't take on that. I like, with everything we've said, but I think the importance of evolving to different stakeholders early, and having different checkpoints at different points, because we meet together once and then at the end, we're not going to be feedbacks, we're not really saying argument or indirect or not, and also kind of re-stating expectations that we go on. Like at the beginning when they're like, oh, this is the problem, that kind of bugs me a little bit, because it's like, how do we know that's the problem? So I think we're going to say, this is our hypothesis, this is what we think is the issue, but say an expectation, we may have findings outside of that tool, and we're going to bring those to you, this is that you're aware. Okay, so clarifying expectations, this may be where we start, but we're going to do a full investigation, making that third repeated. Again, focusing on the needs and what the chapter needs, rather than what they may want. Yeah, great point. Okay, let's go to structural, you've asked the people over here, you know. So we have a multi-prog solution. Okay, as I would expect. As it was, we had two different historical posts. So the first thing we talked about was, right now there's almost 200 volunteers, and so there's a lot of inconsistency with who works with who. And so we talked about earlier, like the conform storm, there's probably a lot of storming happening because these people have worked each other for. So we can trim that body down and have maybe a group of people that result in four or five can work consistent teams that maybe there could be some variation, but you at least work with at least half the people before. And so you can have four consistency with those teams. The only thing we talked about with was the leader right now is kind of acting as a secretary. And there's probably some need for that, but there should be a process where, instead of everyone kind of staying in their lane coming up with their solutions and all coming together at the end, there needs to be an environment, a meeting, whatever it is at the end of the week, where they talk about the big picture. And then that's established, somebody's in charge of writing that big picture down in the report, kind of like an abstract in the paper. And then everyone else is, it needs to tie their individual modules, feedback back to the big picture, so that's not lost either. Okay, so changing structure in terms of the leader, but also the document, and how that fits in. And then you can find something to add on that data. One other thing we discussed was kind of a short video of over laughing people on the modules. So a big thing in insulting is this idea, we're going to give it more of a bias. Hey, we have more than one of them. So I'm going to give an analysis for a key problem. And so by having people on the two people on the module, you're going to one work with that storm, a lot faster, we're happy with that from leader with each other, but you also then when you come back and give this back to leader, the leader is going to say, okay, actually between the two, this is what we're going to do, we're going to get better picture of what the problem actually is, rather than one person's data is. Okay, so providing those different perspectives and over a lot of information, that problem. And then they all start to search. We also have more problems on roads. We talked about things as a team as well, we thought having people when they do it commit a year doing it, and shortly to schedule, because it's so long, right now it's 15 week project, plus the four or five weeks running, and the four afterwards just makes us a part of the ambulance in real time. So having a dedicated team for one year to five, eight week projects instead, so they get better at it, they become a team. And then there's more chance to have my current editor. Okay, so focusing on becoming a team. Alright, okay, right inside, hopefully you can see, like these are all good suggestions, slightly different angles to the topic from, but you know, all things that need to be considered. Okay, you guys want to go back to your seat, and then I'm going to come... I'm just going to go to the office. So this is the way, that's the way you'd like a four or a four. Just like, again, like this is the why. Okay, so I'm going to add a little bit to this, so this idea of team learning from a prior team, becomes that feedback. So Chris, are you emphasized that they should be telling them why this matters, right? Why they're doing it, so really sensitive to that. And we kind of talked about how the kickoff is one of the biggest things because it's what's hopefully going to stick with them. So during the launch, having experience, they're going to remember whether it's true, like that team learning or like modeling in a case thing, so they get to practice it. I also, in the reading, it says they want to be handbooked to be more like a cookbook, which, to be brief, like, could be, has structure, but also creativity into it. And so having, like, maybe you can have that, like, hey, this is how to want you to use it. You have five minutes or like 30 minutes, if something was a team, and use that same recipe, but really good, so that when they're back in the thing, they're like, I remember how we made that process. Yes, now with this team. Okay, so frame cookbook as enabling creativity, and like, make that mental. So, memorable kickoff experience. I think along with the same lines, I thought it was, you know, a long story somewhere that you never see how this career impact matters. Like, we have like a kickoff video where I like, you know what I want to be one, like, could be very unique for, or, you know, the fact that I cross this like, you know, the video recording is just, but like, if you could just, I knew maybe this show last year or the last couple of years, my feedback is sad, I think that could, tonight create that nervousness. Okay, and also in some ways, create that excitement potentially? If I read it right, I don't think they actually go to the place until week 12, but I feel like if you launch in person at the place, met each other, had lunch, like up to see a face, like, if you're more engaging, you know, it's going on. Like, what I do is, you know, I'm like, I just have a wig. Okay, launch in person. So, that would tell the excitement, with feeling like a team, right, so it's all of these things that might help it work better. You might include a trip to Camp Williams in Madden. So, really, I'm going to do a topic experience, but there you go. On the top of that, I'm going to be like, because it's hard to build trust over your coffee, and it's called, and like, the leader's kind of the leader here, but I'm a program officer, probably doing some research on who's going to be on the team, like trying to highlight some of their strengths, what are some of their experience in that first call, so people feel value, but also going to be understanding, like how others can contribute. Okay, yeah, so creating, so we call it a team mental model, right? That's when you know who knows what, it's a transactive memory system, so that they can build on each other. So, highlight strengths, so they know who knows what, but then who build that trust. All right, so. Coming off the bat, so I love building the trust of the team. It's also a great, there's a trust issue between the team and the management. Because we heard that the team was like, well, I don't want to give them my like, partial feedback, because I'm great, ready to go to the dealing with something, because I wonder if, in that lottery, if we could have the team members meet the people who are requesting to see the come in, and just kind of get the, just fill the amount of the figure out, right? This isn't kind of versus going to take my, it might be back. This is one that I actually is interested in applying it, because if we can build that, maybe that expectation that they're, you know, that realization is really excited to implement what those minds. They might be more, really, like, all in one, like, look, like, they're doing a great job, but like, this is an issue, as we're going to. Okay, so all great ideas on, how to launch the team more effectively, right? Essentially making it more of a team, setting those expectations, building that trust, creating that sense of community, but also recognizing that they need to be committed to the chapter that they're reviewing, as well, in terms of providing them useful actions will be back. Okay, so great insights on this. I'm going to put the screen back down. All right, so we highlighted a lot. Some key takeaways is to recognize the role of structure. So here we have, you know, a high level formalization and standardization. But instead of endagely creating the extreme, so they need to be, give it a different light. I'm recognizing the role that team lead, and making it more of a lead, rather than a compiler and a organizer. And then at the end here, we covered, you know, that that launch matters. Kind of back to what we talked about on Monday, how do you clear vision? Right, and you guys talked about expectations, creating those relationships that trust, and a lot of that is through the vision. What are we actually trying to accomplish? So those are some of the big things to take away from this case, as well as recognizing that you're going to have different solutions, you know, from each of those four frames, the political, the symbolic, the HR, the structural. So looking across those. All right, what I'd like you to do now is take some time, reflect in your team. And you can either answer this, what is your shared vision for your team? So reach your heart. You all together in the line with that. Or you guys can spend some time thinking about where you are in the five stages. So are you still norming? How do you start norming? Are those norms effective? You know, you're still in two. So still early, right? Thank you."
