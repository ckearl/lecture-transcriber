  "text": "I was a little bit more honest because on Wednesday, I used to come out on my own research, which was awesome. But I think for me, personally, like better understanding politics and different our dynamics was really high opening when I first started working and was trying to understand, like hard work isn't enough. You have to know the relationship that was going on and kind of digs underneath the surface was really something that I needed to learn. And so I love sharing it with other people as well. So our agenda for today, we're going to talk about hierarchy and different bases of hierarchy. And then we'll spend a good chunk on the top three pace and then finish up by talking about organizational politics. So I'll use what your scores on the local orientation when they're doing this. I'm going to need a couple of examples. All right. So starting with this idea of hierarchy. So we have to start this semester. And we talked about setting vision and this idea that organizations are established to meet goals and objectives. But then the question is, who establishes those goals and objectives? So we started this semester by getting to think about the importance of leaders and setting that vision. But the question is, which leaders are setting that end? You know, as it always coming from the top, what about your manager and your manager's manager, like who's actually setting the goals and objectives? And then this as clearly set as set by the organization or part or there are other things going on. We also know that organizations are coalitions of diverse individuals and interest groups. So you have people that come together to achieve goals and objectives. But they also have their own goals and objectives that they're trying to accomplish. They're trying to understand, like, how are they working together? What's the mutual ground that they find in order to meet their own individual interests that they're after? Also recognizing that enduring differences are going to exist. So even though people may come together to achieve something, they still have those individual interests that they're fighting for. And so that can make coalitions more or less enduring as they're going after their individual interests. And then also recognizing that power and hierarchy, a lot of that is deciding how scarce resources get allocated. So who gets what? Where do those resources go? And why is that? And seeing conflicts that arise is when you have fighting over those scarce resources and the allocation of those resources. And then also recognizing exactly what I just said that there's conflict. So if you have scarcity of resources, different ideas about how to allocate those resources, that's going to lead to conflict. And so power comes in to resolve that conflict. And decide where those resources actually go to resolve this conflict. We're recognizing as well that there's going to be a lot of negotiating, bargaining, and jockeying for a position as people try a certain power, claim power, use power, in order to get resources and decisions made in the way that they want. So thinking about how power comes into play in terms of allocating resources. So if we put this all into a helpful diagram, we start with scarcity of resources. So you're going to see politics, the application of power, when you have scarcity of resources. It's going to be more likely in those situations. So scarcity of resources. And then you have heterogeneous goals and plans. So not only do you have scarcity of resources, but you have different ideas about what to do with those resources, where you're trying to accomplish and your plans for accomplishing that. And add into that that you're interdependent. So that you rely on one another in order to get things done and to allocate those resources, which ultimately result in conflict. So an example of this in a hiring situation. So hiring at the YU, those lines to hire faculty into, those are scarce resources. Trying to decide who gets to have those faculty lines. And so different departments and schools have different goals and plans for using those faculty lines. But we are interdependent on one another in order to create a good education for our students, which creates some conflict. So how you kind of see this playing out, not only at NYU, but other universities across the state, across the country, is you have these scarce faculty lines, scarce resources. And there's a question of how this should be allocated. And you see a lot of degree programs being shut down because they're not serving enough students. And so those faculty lines are going into places like the Business School, where we have more students interested in our programs. So we're getting more resources, which creates conflict between business schools and other departments across campus, because we're getting these scarce resources, or we're still part of the same organization. So create this conflict. And then what comes into solid is this use of power. And so resolving the conflict, you often see administrators in the university context deciding who gets those resources, not that it completely solves the conflict, but it decides, what are the goals that we're going to follow? What are we going to prioritize? Questions about this? Thoughts that you guys had as you did the readings inside of it? Maybe you hadn't had before. Yes. Question and a thought. That these powerhouses that we come from, like some high level of air and authority, right now, these meetings, I think, have come from just some different examples. Natural influence, and those skills are different. Yes. We're going to get more in that in this minute. But this I get, yes, power comes from the estimation in the higher fee, but also the other source of your work. So you're expecting expertise, your reputation, maybe the connections that you have with other people, and all these power. So this have a name, this framework, or is it just the use of power? Let's call it the use of power. Power framework. OK. So to do a little bit deeper on Joseph's question about power, let's look at an example of someone trying to exercise power and not necessarily succeed. 7 Winks. Were your words? Why did we not have any manager or 3 year now? No, oh, you feel like three months. Let's see. We all have to punch into a time clock which is very old, very strong, and has the slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now junior employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's a 10-30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours. Stop stalling! There's one problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you and you won't mind. Okay? Don't share it. Joe Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. Ooh, about what? That's on a need to know bases. I thought I needed to know for your counter. You should all meet in green. So I can be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be in subordinates. Nor will you, phoenix, insurrection. Question, if we've already fallen into insurrection, may we need grandfather then? Define fulfillment. Unifine fulfillment. Please take note of the new colloquial system. Oh my god, what is wrong? Yeah, why are you late? It's none of your business. Actually, it's very medical and personal. All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. I'm just stupid. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling. The part which did. I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be in my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life, because I am manager of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, acting manager. Wow, he really embraced the whole bond villain aesthetic. Oh Jim Jim Jim. The gun is a bum on Alex. Joe collects them. I thought that that's a nice small talk about it. And the promise is a rescue. And the desk. The desk is a replica of Odae Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in his week. But I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to this list. Joe is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior. I promise other people that I'll be on my list. I'm a worse behavior. I need my word. So don't make me fire you. You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing gun. So make me pre-fire you. You wouldn't dare. Watch this. You're pre-fire. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fire. If you get promoted. And if you haven't fallen in love with me by an end of time. No, I thought there was a real chance that way it would be permanent manager. I would pre-quit. And you might be saying yourself. I love this look because it's a good example of the way I'm trying to exercise power and acting as an assistant. So as you think about power, basic definition of power is control over resources valued by others. So what kind of resources is why trying to control in that work? Most. Most of them. Right? Such as? Coffier. Coffier. Coffier. Internet. My time. Lunch time. Lunch time. Right? He's trying to show that he can control the resources and affect the way that work is done. And he's trying to be force of right, trying to get people to do what he wants them to do. Especially with Jim trying to be force of in that way. So studying up an example of someone trying to exercise power, not successfully I would say, but trying by controlling those resources valued by others. And oftentimes this kind of use of power can be coercive if it necessarily always coercive, but can be a definitely why trying to use it in a coercive way. And so when someone is trying to exercise their power over people, people may do what is asked of them because they feel like they have to. Right? In order to get the reward that they're after or avoid punishment, they're going to do what this person in power says that they are supposed to do. And contrast of power is the idea of status. And status is really granted upon you by the group that you're a part of. And so for status is the respect, prestige, and admiration granted by others. Does white have status? No, no. You really don't. He's not admired by other people in the office. They're not granting him the status. So he lacks this more voluntary kind of influence where people want to do things for someone that's higher in status because they admire them. It's more voluntary. You look up to this person so you want to do what they've asked you to do. Can you guys think of examples of people that you know that have high status that you are willing to defer to? She definitely has high status. And we could say that she also has high power, right? Or she's able to control some resources that way. Our church leaders? Yeah. So we definitely give status to our church leaders. We admire and respect them. We want to learn from them and hear what they have to say. And it's voluntary. So oftentimes, power is the most important thing to do. And we're going to be more of a status that is going to be correlated, but not always. So we're going to dig a little bit more into when they're not always correlated. So going back to Joseph's question at the beginning of where power and all of the status can come from. So power often comes from that formal authority, so your position and the hierarchy, so from your title. But it can also come from control over rewards, resources, or information. So you probably know some administrative assistance that have a lot of power because of the information that they control. So even though they're not higher in the hierarchy, they control information to power. And then also this idea of centrality. So there's central in the network. You have to go to them in order to be connected to other people that can also be the power. On the other side, so status more of that informal kind of position and the hierarchy often builds on relationships. So who you know, who they know, your reputation. So what kind of track record do you have in the organization? What do people know about you that can build your status in the organization? Also your expertise, whether you know to be able to do. And then personal attributes that people simply like to and want to be around you. And so that can give you some status in the organization. And so power and status are the different bases that can give you, you know, a position in the hierarchy. So people come to you in order to be able to. And so looking at them a little bit deeper, some of the effects of power. So there's been a number of studies looking at what happens when people feel like they have power. And what they doubt is that when people have power, feel like they have power, they're more action oriented or confident or optimistic. And I think we can take risks. So really more approach. We call it approach orientation. Willing to go out there. What's interesting is high on power. Makes you more focused on your own interests. And you feel like you have power control of your resources. You're a lot more focused on your own interests. On the flip side, when you're higher in status, you're more focused on the interests of others. Recognizing that these other people, they're the ones that are giving you their admiration. So you're more concerned about their interests than your own. So showing different behaviors, bases of power. When you're higher in power, you're also less inhibited. So less likely to follow social norms, social cues. You think you get to do whatever you want. Tenth the saying, absolute power. Roughs absolute food, right? This idea that when you have power, yes, it is true that you're less likely to follow social norms and be inhibited by those social norms. Which can create problems as well. So thinking about those leaders that get power and then do things that are really in the service of their own interests. Another difficult situation is when you have someone that has a position of power that low status. So do you think about white? Someone that has arguably a position of power, is a separate, but low status. He doesn't have the respect of others. These kinds of managers are going to be more authoritarian, more restrictive, auxus ordinance, and likely to hold people back. Unless likely to listen to their employees, be well-liked. What do you do if you have a boss like this? Quit. Yeah. So you can try and work with it. But if you can't address this situation, quit, transfer, remove yourself from this situation. Usually what's going on here is this kind of manager can tell that they're not respected and they don't feel and control. And so they have a sense of insecurity. So if you can manage that sense of insecurity and address it, it can improve the situation, but it's often a very difficult situation to change. So some examples for that. If you have ideas, suggestions you want to make, this is the kind of boss where you don't make them in a public meeting. You make them in private, you let them take credit for those ideas, and recognize that they might be able to meet back. And so the more you can document your own ideas and the work that you are doing, the safety will be. But the best idea is you find yourself in a situation trying to remove yourself from it. Questions about this? Go ahead and jump into the Thomas Green case. You're a Thomas Green Jack. I'll be sure. I'll be sure. I'll be sure. I'll be sure. So now the situation between Davis and Davis, what is causing the conflict? Why do we have conflicts? The green initiate is going in to give us much of a care for the opposite policy. So here's the kind of thing that can be done to help you out with everybody. And so then just cure your felt friends. Okay. So green trying to dazzle. And Davis just threatened. If we put it into the power framework, what's the scarcity here? What are Thomas and Green, sorry, Green and Davis, fighting. Okay. I think this is making it going. I'm just making part of it. I would also say perhaps access and how they're viewed by McDonald. Okay. So McDonald's attention. I'd even say the position that Green is holding because there's only one person who has that job title. And Davis doesn't like his in it and Green does like his in it. And there's a scarcity of that position. Yeah. The conflict over how Green got that and the fact that he's back. All right. So we have to see some scarcity of resources here. What if we build out the rest of this framework? What else is creating conflict? Part of it is that like Green is very public about the problems that he's having. He first in the meeting, he like brought up that like, oh, I don't think that's reasonable. And then later he was talking to other managers saying like, oh, he doesn't like me because I did that earlier. Okay. And so if we put it into like heterogeneous goals, right? So different of opinions about those targets. Is one part of it? Yeah. Also the interdependence that they have like in order for Davis to like be able to report up to the stakeholders. He needs like courts from Green. He's like, what do you mean by time? So it's like there are some legitimate like inefficient people that I feel like he's experiencing with Green's like what we're talking about. Okay. So being these green information in order to report up. I think we just both have a different idea as to how to achieve those goals. Even if they may be aligned, they both seem to be doing their own fault. He says you should be doing it this way. No, I want to do it this way. So it's very different. Okay. Very different approaches to how we get to work done. They just have different leadership styles. They was like very practical and structured and all the way. This is the number I give you. You have to achieve it. But I think like you're on like 28 years old and things like. So young. Yeah. I knew at this I want to count the things I want you to start for. You raise me. Okay. Very different styles than our having some potentially generational things going on as well. Anything else? Yes. Do you have green stuff? I have. And so we set a sales metric based on his own experience. And I think that you've been in green. Like not even bothered to talk about it. Yeah. So we had his own experience. He set the target. And green is pushing back. Okay. So yeah. I'm just going to say one more thing with independence. The green is also a dependence on how it's like approval to end this position. And even though he doesn't like it. So he still has independence on it. Okay. After all, Davis is the boss. So create the situation where he does mean something. Okay. So they're definitely engaged in conflict here. And having problems as they try and do this. So Joseph comes to you about the different sources of power, which is spinning. So what do you think? If you think about, you can start with either Davis Green or StarVow. I don't think he went to the UK. The UK is a source of power. So it's a pretty strong step. The fact that the record kind of came in. And he thinks that it's been working really well. And so he got a lot of recognition for that from higher ups. So he got it on the bus with McDonald's. Maybe that's another one. So I can get a connection with that. Yeah. 100%. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Now I'm going to do a leave of Davis's boss. I think we can interact with him. Okay. So how does this informal power right through his passive sets? This connection would make Donald. Other thoughts about Green? I don't know if this is a source or something, but it really pretty much hits all of the high power thing he listed. He's very accurate and optimistic, risk-taking, which we've been using by all of his assets. Like I said, he's got it in his street. And he's got a traffic route. He's more of what he's done. It's around his people's level. Okay. So he definitely feels powerful. Definitely exhibiting those behaviors for sure. So it's definitely true or not? Do you think that's about Green's power? It's confident. Okay. He definitely was a very good salesperson. So it's a very competent mindset. He's trying to get back into some other stories. Kind of seems like that's not working. But the point that he's like sitting down right seeing that, he feels like everybody's kind of mad at him. But that is a possible source of motivation. Yeah. So he's definitely trying to build that coalition and create that environment he faced. Yeah, just to his point is what I think it's because he mentioned that he was recounting other managers and getting things like support saying, keep speaking your mind, don't back down. So he was getting that from people who were as involved. Correct. His history like, that is also an alumni in the same university as you get from Grandma. So his connection with the old dogs, right? Creating that similarity and that lightness of right, they like each other. All right. Let's shift a little bit to David. What's the purpose of power to save that? He's experienced and he's age. Okay. Experience. Time that this is age, his experience in the company. I mean, he's his boss. So we had that legitimate power. He is the boss. He doesn't have that role. He works his decision with the AI and he's also expecting and going to the AI to that sense of that. So he used KPI to keep the AI. Yes, it's right. Yeah. So that's the KPI's and the goals. Great. So the set of the expectations part of his legitimate power to do that. Part of his power is also like for lack of evidence. He didn't have like a guess, but like showing what he done with the last five months and the green way out of the black hand. Yeah. So the lack of evidence, the green has his evidence and his power of illustration. Okay. So we have a lot of those expectations. And we have those reporting requirements. The green spot. He controls an area of white green's performances to the top. Ah, right where is that? So. And that kind of goes up to Alex's point too. What is the story you can tell and it pre-doves it reporting that David control that narrative. But then we see the hurry weight over the narrative too, right? You know, obviously as a respect, I think that all of the world will see the speed about these things there. Or feels after the warning that the situation is going to be fine. I'm going to put a question on whether he actually has her respect. You definitely can report to her, but that's my next question that I don't want to get into. I was going to say it's almost like another source of power for green. So we get back to that level and had him skip the level. So now her, you know, how her is in question is she's been like over all people. And so she has her respect and his point. Okay. Because she did kind of make this unusual move down. Just to add to that, Alex said also the fact that she reached out to me directly to get his side of what was happening. I don't think that always would happen, so that might imply that there's more respect for green than it is. Yeah. So let's look a little bit deeper on this question of their agendas, their respect to agendas. So we're starting to speculate about McDonald's agendas. So what do you think? What does McDonald's agendas? Well, the green performances have not created and not what the rest of management knows based off of the agendas. That makes the level more fat. And you want to run it with it. Okay. So she wants to protect her reputation. What else, Jacob? It's interesting that you put Davis and Green together. So he's going to be very opposite work types. The green seems very social and very kind of collaborative. Or Davis seems very structured in data driven. Often people who do those are kind of on obsidence. So together they have potential to both become better. There will be areas they've been balanced by the other person. So I can see her wanting them both to grow through it. But also recognizing that it's kind of a risk. Okay. So assuming good intentions, do you want them to grow and learn from each other in one way? She wants growth and performance and the company to generate revenue. Okay. So ultimately protecting her reputation is leading to increased performance and trying to get the organization that way. I think trying to kind of breed a new generation of leadership in the organization. Because obviously we talked about how Davis has experienced the their own time. And that Green is a young and new and likely now to proceed into future. Okay. So trying to build the talent in the organization. She once done to both be really close to each other. Her stated objective differently. So in regards to this position was that you should seek mentorship from it. Based on the boss. And I think that it goes back to Jacob's point. Like she wants them to be working together in tandem and be very close. And so I think this situation is like the exact opposite of her. And then it's like they're not in the community. Yeah. So again this idea of learning from each other in order to lead growth. Okay. For a minute I want you guys to like fully dig from Green's perspective. You are coming through. What does Green think a Donald's agenda is? And a fire? What could you think Green's or McDonald's agenda is? What does Green think McDonald's agenda is? Yeah. What's Green's perspective? It's perspective on McDonald's. I have. I'm a McDonald. Probably that she's smart because she wrote a pen. I think she's a huge, so he likes her. Okay. So Green's awesome. And Green thinks Green's awesome. I think he's overly confident in her because she's like she hired me. I'm done. So I think he just thought that she was going to have his back ultimately. Uh-huh. And it kind of overstated their relationship. Okay. So this assumption that she would have his back. Strongly. Right? It's really strongly that she's going to be there for him. What other assumption can Green made about McDonald's? She, he like, or Green thinks that McDonald trusts him to like be confident at his job. So he doesn't really care what Davis thinks. I guess. So as soon as that she trusts him, that all he has to do is impress McDonald. Christine, maybe along with that is a little bit of an assumption that she is a little bit more confident. Davis, that much could be just like kind of, uh, overstep that level and she's on him. Um, so yeah, I wonder if the part is like attitude towards Davis was modeling what he thinks. I think he probably feels pretty good. Yeah. So he's definitely making this assumption that maybe McDonald doesn't trust Davis. And maybe that's okay, right? Yeah, I think it's simply a good question. You know, if you don't, Davis, is modeling this is it? Certainly I think from a third party, I was also acting like I was trying to shift look, dynamic, that going on, you're getting this thing at the old right, you see in the meeting where it's in, there is kind of this, nobody helps. Is going to say anything else against Davis? And you want to get down, you want to open it up to, this is an engine, more aware of, 30 degrees in, five degrees, and back to back to back to the introvert. McDonald knows what he wants against Davis. Is this really very low? Definitely raising some questions here, right? Which would be weird, because he just get promoted to that role and presumably McDonald had promoted him. So I don't know if she's like trying to set him up or what? Yeah, it's not clear, right? This is an ambiguous situation. He's in both ways, and you see green interpreting it one way, but not necessarily the effect. I feel like by the time that this is sitting place, one screen is that you know from the bottom. He basically says that he thought that he, that should go about with him no matter what. But now just realizing that night, not being a case, he seems to have an aspect of like, I don't know if she's going to go with him or with Davis. And somebody who seems very uncertain, like he thought that he had a huge protective, like just took for granted at all of a sudden, she's not there to protect himself. Okay, for me, this uncertainty, maybe you just read it, right? And didn't fully understand this situation. Okay, so green finds himself in the situation. Let's think for a minute about Davis's agenda. From the perspective of Davis, right? What's Davis's agenda? What does he try to accomplish? Big double digit growth goal, but he said? Yeah. But he wants growth, fur his target. Unity, he's frustrated with that, reads book God against the meaning. So at least that makes patient. Okay, so green is his employee, his mortem, and they should be needed. Ailey, he also dispossits reports and documentation of what is the work that's actually moving. Okay, so we want documentation. In some ways, we could say he wants the information, right? We want that information from Green. I think he honestly wants green out, because he's keeping very detailed memos on exactly what green is called. Very detailed. That's how long it's been. Which given what we know about Davis, is it shocking that he would have detailed documentation? Not really. Jay. I feel like a lot of this was a primed on Green's perspective by the guy saying, hey, you might have a situation with Davis, because he thought he would not choose the successor. So he could see a lot of interpreting from his side. And then Davis said, hey, I was supposed to choose this. Now I'm going to deal with this guy. He's not even tracking his calendar, he's even doing all these basics for documentation and for giving data. So I think from Green's perspective, he's probably trying to see certain suspicious issues and then Davis was expected to say, I thought I was going to be able to choose this successor and deal with the need to grow first and try to train the guy in the Howard Fictionary Basis. Okay. So in some ways, maybe his sub-davises into that is maybe is always trying to reassert his power. He's in the higher green. And so maybe by pushing him out, he's reasserting his power over the situation. Is this why he showed us the white gym thing? Because it kind of seems like a white gym thing. No, I just really love that kind of thing. But similar principles apply, right? So this power is statused and trying to assert power. But yes. To first of all, an anti-shade that Davis, I know he'll have some like he wants to screen out, and I think that probably would be true. But I do appreciate that he's like, hey, I want some marketing strategy. I want some leadership. I want some like, I'll be here and like contribute. But he also wants it in the way that he wants it, rather than in like the way that maybe Green wants to do that. So maybe they both want the same thing that they want in different ways. But I do appreciate what he's got. Okay. So he wants Green to grow in Davis's style, right? Edit his own image. Trying to push it in that way. I think he probably just wants to feel like a good leader too. Because from his perspective, he's like, Green is like a lot of dating calendar. He's not in the state. He says he's in the G.S. That's right. Not giving the answers of a report stack after being asked multiple times. And so like, I'm getting some like, these aren't huge things I'm asking for. And they're just like being completely in love. So again, this idea of trying to mentor, like he's been told to mentor this employee. He's trying to mentor him in his style, which maybe that's why McDonald's living together and continuously is her best friend. I think it's also interesting that they've planned as having problems with Green's style as well. So this being gives us kind of a moral position, like it kind of makes sense that Davis is getting a little bit upset because they're losing client relations. So he wants to do those clients relations, right? And he knows he's client. So he's like, Green should listen to him. All right, so we see some different agenda, different things that people are trying to accomplish. What I wanted to do next is take us way, way back to orientation meetings when we talk about conflict management stuff. So we talk about vibes that are in conflict management stuff. We want to remember that the vibes were in the way back. I remember there was competitive, collaborative, collaborative, collaborative, collaborative. Oh, it excited now. Yeah, it's a collaboration, collaborative, what is your combination? Okay. So we're going to go through and get a job. What approach is Green taking to conflict? A avoidance. A avoidance. Right? So what tells us that he's avoiding? He's getting older. He's getting older. He's getting older. Because we respond to Davis, right? He just continues to do his own thing. What approach do you think that is being created? He's got some collaborative. What we need to be to work on is to have some different ways between what's being done. And it's really important to have a conversation. This is why I want to. Okay, so he starts with trying to collaborate. So they have mutual interest. They both want the company to do well. So trying to collaborate. But then he ultimately ends up just competitive. So competing for his own interest and trying to get those. Okay. So given what we know now, what do you recommend that Green do? So what should Green's approach be doing for? I think Green is reminding you of a vicious man thing. He can do a lot of things without going through the system. I think he had to learn that. He's not a guy with a trust fund. So he had to learn to do the right thing and play the game. I actually incorporate it with each Davis. Okay. So what approach is to play the game? So what would that look like? What would the game be that he's playing? I think it goes down to if he wants to convince Davis that Green does not agree with this plan. And if he wants to convince Davis to do something different, then he's providing the data instead of just how to give his understanding. So being able to make his case in a way that Davis would understand. In his perspective. Okay. So understand Davis and take that approach. So using the data. What are you using the data for? I'm sharing. Here's the data on why you're double the distance plan. So I'll work with you. Here's why I think my way is right. Okay. So use the data to revise the sales target. So still convince Davis. Okay. Okay. Does he Davis is wrong? Another. I think the point he's at. Like, I think he needs to document really well. One, what he's doing. So he has a case for McDonald. If she says, hey, have you been doing anything? He needs to document like, diskey accomplishments. And how things are, how the activities he's doing are going to build. Grow up in the future because he said he's kind of investing in longer term. Activities right now, which could be very beneficial, but aren't as visible. So he needs to document that and show it to like, talk to green about that. But also have that kind of a security for McDonald. I'd also say that at this point, like when there's already conflict and he thinks Davis doesn't like him, he should have like a list of things he's documenting that Davis is doing. Like, almost, I don't want to say like insurance, but his argument of, hey, these are unreasonable things that I've tried to work with them on. And they're not working out. And I want to like, I had a boss like this once a manager like this. And I had a full note of things and I was like, our document. Like, he asked me to do this at this time. He didn't show up on this client all. He left me hanging in this way. And I just, I never like shared him. I just thought, okay, I had been, I don't want to get burned and like things get blamed on me. So if someone comes and says, why is this not working, I want to be able to like say, hey, like, there were a few multiple incidents where things have happened that I've documented those. I don't want to be so influential. Okay. So, as a reading document, what you are doing, the message that you're setting, what you're doing, and what your column from goal is. And then also documenting Davis' actions and how he made the following short. It's hard to say. Yeah, I just wanted to add up the comment. I really like that approach. And I think also keeping in mind, like, this is your answering. So like, kind of like, your superior. And if I think not publicly, like calling it out, maybe. Yeah. I think that's one of the four that you've got. And the one. Totally serious. The direction of the relationship also, just pointing aside. Yeah. I think with criminal delivery, you can really address any object with anyone. You just have to have it through the right criminal delivery. Okay. So building back on this idea, yes, for Davis' wrong, but not publicly. So, born with Davis to the left. I think you should look on the other job. Yeah. It's kind of targeted already. Okay. So, please, why do you think he should... Not leave. Just look for it. Oh. Okay. Okay. So look for another job. So what's the full strategy here? It's probably a drag scenario. You even know he is. Because we weren't asked when we were getting reports of full sites. We're not sure if Davis is 100% accurate in reports or either Green is just a traditional guy and whatever. So, but, of course, it's already been said. Davis doesn't like him. And next door, no, I'm not lacking the couple weeks. And the company suddenly is probably the first somebody to be laid off. So we do this from a job, we have a job. So, ultimately, we still need it. Okay. Okay. So, let's look at all five other job when you have a job, 80. So I think Green needs to accept that he actually makes mistakes. I need to be humble about it. Because he has something to learn here. And that is that he didn't play the game. He didn't report to Davis. He didn't try to listen to him. So I think he needs to be humble. And he needs to, you know, accept that he makes mistakes. Okay. So, accept that you've made mistakes. Yeah. I got a pushback on college's idea of what was going to be sorry about that. If you are in leadership position, if you have to quit on another position, every time you face pushback, you would never learn a role. Like, prepare the relationship, learn the office politics. You know, like, make yourself visible or proactive. And don't put yourself in like a victim role, a photomactone, like, make yourself like, I'm here, I'm new, I'm here to learn. I'm young, but I'm interested to do whatever it takes. And, yeah. Just avoid blaming people on them. Okay. That would be a mental problem. I think both options are valid for another job or staying with each piece of the site. He's willing to change and play the game. Yeah. The heat should come into that. He's 30 days away from being fired probably. And it sounds like a good reason. Yeah, he's been free fired. But if he's unwilling to adapt to what this new role requires, and what he requires, then he's not spying too, because it looks for a role that's better. Okay. So make a decision on whether you're willing to change it or not. Recognize that change could be required. Yeah, I'm just going to act like he's just said that. I mean, you should all give him something like an advice that he often would give me. Which is like, to make friends and to like cross-strain himself and to like compensate for his experience, quite like he is. He's an awareness of the management of the image. So I'll just need to do that for us. From his, I'm just going to need to suppose that I want to. Okay. So recognizing that he's ignoring it largely, I don't care if that's his report. I was going to add that he needs to ignore the next one, stand by. What does that mean by that? He needs to be able to have a good fabricate or a good solution for all his businesses. Knops are like a mall. He needs to be able to do this. Even if he doesn't, he's going to say that he's going to like, he's going to like, he's going to run. He needs to use that to heart a little bit and try not to get out of these short points. I think he's going to be very sure he's starting a good job for three months. I think he's only been a short time. I think he's going to say that he's going to stand. And he's going to say that he needs to be able to do this. He needs to be able to do this. So, I think he's going to be able to do this. I think he's going to be able to do this. Okay, so kind of acknowledge that he was wrong, follow it Davis and MacDonald. We're recommending, prepare the relationships. There's still time to do all of these things. I feel like he also needs to just stop doing whatever he wants. I mean, I feel like even another thing that's not very specifically mentioned, but that's in the cases. He received the email from MacDonald at 9 a.m. But then the case he says that he received it in the after-bending. So it just leaves something of like, I feel like in what he's doing, there's a lot of emailing. So you would assume that he'd be able to date with emails and not have an email right back at 9 a.m. and not read it until late afternoon. If he's doing what he's supposed to be doing. And so if this is the first thing we're going to do, he's trying to throw an off and do in his own hand. He's having a time that he's going and flying off to a different site. So he talks to the county that I do this. I'm going to have to find for it. And then he's getting the info on that today. So it goes off to another site. And so he's kind of just going by the seat of his own hands and not really doing what he's supposed to be doing. So he's sending me some of the things like, oh, I got this email in the after-bending. And he's going to be able to really understand that it's a fortnight a.m. And she said, I want to see your back. He's starting to start looking on this. And here he is going home. I thought he'd be busy with that. I didn't even mention anything to the other. Yeah, I need a little bit more time to think about this. I also want to work on it. He doesn't say anything to record. He's just going to be seeing us blow me up. I just trying to keep it up. So, and so it goes. Can we get another phone number? Right. All right. Last couple of comments. I'm going to be turning things on and then H.C. I mean, in general, I'm not like playing the game, but he's literally not doing job. I'm just starting to do job. I maybe he is. Okay. Do you want his job? You like a radical bond. And I've been one of the emails today that's literally said, like, I feel like I have to make a tremendous report. He's not selling defiance. He's just agreeing with clients. Like talking about this message. All these things. Yeah. Do his job. Okay. I think it's interesting that he creates these like long term career goals, but then it doesn't play the game with the relationship, which is half of what gets you to promotion it. That's what got him to his first promotion. Right. So, it's like, yet he's playing the game from like, I'm making all these long term things. But he's not playing the build a relationship for the long term. Yeah. So, he's missing something essential here. I think Bri needs to stop taking things personally because he always thinks that, that is, you know, David is hard to get in. Yeah. In the interactions, if he's like he's being given the job to creditors, so that he could influence. Yeah. And then I like how David is very objective in his suggestions. And he's not taking things just trying to help me improve on his job. Okay. So, his perspective is a little bit off, right? He's assuming that Davis is out to get out. Which is interesting because you guys will talk about giving feedback in HR. And like, she'll make point out, Davis did a good job of focusing on specific behaviors. Like, I need to see these things from you. Not completely out there in misbehaving, but you're very specific about the behaviors. All right. I can't wait. I saw your hand. Oh, it's a quintessential. Okay. All right. I'm going to go ahead and we're going to move on to this discussion of politics. But I'm also telling you what Thomas Green did. All right. So, what do you think he actually did? He could work on it. Move to Atlanta. I think I'm going to fight with him. I said he could play it. I said he could play it. He said. The roomie colored Basis here with Davis is not fully directed but unless I would assume that really Marian is singing as big as he needs it. Davis kind of boarded out for me from the beginning, I'm getting very short on work. He's firstly heldг we have some butterflies back. But like a month ends, assessing like hey, these are all my failures. He's an attacker at health problems. So, I would assume that you don't have to do the same thing as just class. Okay so, after that, you went out to Davis. So kind of building out the! the best suggestion of using data. He built a data based framework of how Davis was wrong, but didn't take it to Davis. He took it to the other people in the organization and built a coalition against Davis. That's crazy. He was. He was. He was. Oh, it's a guy. He was effective at getting Davis moved. So essentially, Davis didn't get fired. He just got moved. That's crazy. He was. And Green had damaged all his relationships in the process. And so within the year, he went and got his MBA. I know he did our class. That's. That's. That's. That's. That's. I assume he has that. Eric. All right. He's. He's. He's. He's. Last thing I want to talk about today was politics. I don't want to think about politics. We think about organization. Or we think about, you know, national politics which creates this like, I don't know, with the feeling. My goal today is that when you hear about organizational politics, you're like, yes, this is how we create change in organizations. And see like the positive side of organizational politics. Because as we talk about them in an organizational context, the idea in my hope always for organizational politics is figuring out how to do things that will benefit under people and the organization. So often when we think about politics, we think about, you know, signing up, the relationships that lead to unfair treatment. And you can also think about organizational politics as a way of working together to guide the organization to beneficial. And at the end of the day, we need to be aware of how decisions are made, what relationships are important, so that you can help decide how resources get allocated and also understand what kind of authority you have and what role you can play. So I don't know, with my little background or not, but this idea of being able to advocate for others, to advocate for the benefit of others and the organization, I think it's really critical in recognizing how you can help get resources to where they need to be in order to be successful at an organizational level. So yes, there's definitely this dark side of politics. By keeping in mind, there's also a bright side, right? So being able to use those to your advantage. Because in reality, organizations are political. All organizations are political. I mean, we think about NYU, church affiliated school, well run, there are still politics. Right, there are still relationships that help direct resources to be aware of that helped you know, who do I need to talk to really in order to get changes made and how can that work? Because you can use politics for helping productive reasons. Like for example, you know, within the business school, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago, there weren't majors, right? You couldn't major in, you couldn't major in HR, there were just these fantasies, but there were the wide group trying to say, for the benefit of our students, we need to have majors and these are the majors that we should have. So using politics in order to create a situation that's better for those students, and how do you push that through? And then also recognizing for you as an individual, you're unlikely to get ahead if you're not aware of those politics, right? And I think we see that in the Thomas Green case, where he didn't really understand the importance of the relationships or managing those relationships, it seemed to have a disconnect there, which ultimately led to problems for him, he was able to overcome them, but created a more difficult situation than it needed to be. So especially as you think about your own careers, recognizing what relationships do you need to manage? Who do you need to have strong relationships with in order to have a better perspective of what's going on? So just to reemphasize some points here, politics are gonna happen, so be aware of them so that you know how to marshal and make sure that you get resources where they need to go. And it's all about trying to do things that can benefit the collective. Obviously, there are some positive consequences of voting change to operations of building those coalitions. It's important creating new organizational goals that you're trying to accomplish and improving decision making, but clearly there are also some negative consequences. I'm sure what I said politics is because those negative consequences, people getting promoted that you're like, why did the person get promoted? But trying to see the flip side of that, of how do you actually navigate and make sure that you're not on the losing side there? All right, so I had you guys take the school to the questionnaire, so you should have your score if you could get. So the person that created it, his average one, he wrote about, was about 21. I'm not gonna talk about that. The class average between the two sections this year is 38, which is about two points higher than last year's. So, what's the difference between the two sections? The range for you guys this year between 17 and 60, so, what's the difference between the two sections? Okay, so what are these good things? What are these scores? So no one's scored in this Machiavellian. So, we're gonna take away two far right, so, three to the fifth list, yes. Like we create and move. Well, no one was in the zone. No, no, no. Okay, the class we got was this country politician. So, obviously, the audience actually very keen to fill in the bucket. So, about our sense of rebellion at the Ex-Semmati-Galian, but really aware, hydro aware of the politics of how you play that. Most of you fell and you use body tube buckets, so, survivalists, so, recognizing politics, and the advantage of that, most MBAs fall in the end of these buckets, and have politics ticketed into your way around. How you normally really use and mark your way around. And then you also fell into your Aero buckets, so, trying to avoid politics. The police, the people are honest and hardworking, and that you get ahead by being honest. No. If you take not this way, if you want to take away, then working hard is only half the game. You also have to recognize the relationships and what's going on around you in order to fully speak to you and be able to be productive in this organization. So, hard work is important, it's only part of the puzzle. So, be mindful of the entire puzzle. Thoughts you guys have as you see this. Perfect. I feel like if someone's mock you, they're giving them a negative like their response to this two-point-to-there, and I can't fall in one of those. LAUGHTER Especially if a day is like going to be seen somewhere, even if it's anonymous, I feel like they're best doing interesting. I still can't. So, they're self-aware, they're very bad. I don't know. I don't know what to do, very bad. I can't say that. LAUGHTER No, I have a question. I think this survey was like a really bad survey. Like, no, I don't think you didn't make it. But like, if half the questions were like, oh, how do you view the world and how do you think about people? And the other half was like, do you look like live cheese? I don't think that you're about live for whatever. Like, it's like your hair over the nose. People don't have to do questions on it. Even if you're like, oh, yes, I do love to live cheese. You don't have to be afraid. I'm like, you're not even safe. But even if it's anonymous, it's not going to be all that's going to be nice. Fair group dance. I'm sorry, good. That was a good one. You take it. Let's go. So at some point, just in case for my opinion, control from people who may understand. All fits for not care. Yeah. Which I think is an excellent point. And the question for you all is, at what point do you understand and just decide you're not going to play the game first and understand the not to be so good at the game? It's kind of the same for yourself where you sit. My hope is that you at least understand or is the game going on? And then you should be trying to play that. I think I come from, I don't know. My dad was like, NBA and like, you know, working corporate America, my husband comes from more of like an entrepreneur, blue collar type family. And so like, they're his, you know, the way he grew up has a lot to do with building relationships. And believing people are good, even though like, there's specific experiences his parents have had where they have been burned before. But they still like believe that. But I'm like, okay, well, if you're going to be in corporate America, like, it's kind of interesting because I feel like I push this on him of like, just because like your manager likes your runs on Strava, I think that's cool. Like maybe like we should, you know, like think about how that might be perceived or how that could be utilized. And he's like, no, but like, we have a good relationship. I was like, yeah, but like, this is corporate America. And so like, maybe I'm too, I think this is like kind of just the way I grew up and the way that like South Korea is and they're extremely hierarchical and political. So it's like, I feel like I'm almost like over accounting. And he, it's like, they're maybe a happy medium. But I just think it's like, I laugh about it because I talk about this. Like, all the to be transparent. I was just, I was right at 61. I don't, you know, but whether people want to know that or not. But it's just, it's just, I think it's funny. Just the way that, how that is. Well, without stress, I might fall into the block. Perhaps. Right? And do that optimistic, trusting and hopeful. Like, if I could work hard, it's going to work out. Right. I was right here. You know, you can be taken advantage of. And this is how you happen to take the shots. We're going to be grateful. Other. You guys. The thought of the phone is very important. I think you're like captain Roni in the approach for you. Like, I want to be the best at work there's been because I'm here. I'm going to be on the other side. And the finding is already, it says those who get used to power their advantage will be the worst. There's no need to deal with those who gain power will be zip wise here just later. It's not like, okay, so kind of my job and being the price like later is to be better at this task. And then all the best you will out there. It's like you do a good price like way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I would take that in frame as price like leaders. We want status, right? We want that respect from others which means that we need to be thinking about their interests and needs and how we can understand situation, be able to navigate these in a way that's going to benefit others. So really that focus on others and to be that out of power. Yeah. Oh, I was just going to say that. I appreciate the next comment of recognition of the politics that I wanted to participate in. Sort of this mentality of, am I trying to play the role of my trying to change the game right? A lot of people, there's a lot of people that are going to be on board to say things later the way that I'm going to be. I can't. Other than seeing this like a question, I'm going to tell you this. There is kind of a balance of how far we're going to go. And I'm not going to let you know, demonstrate that with people that once I'm ahead, you have to do this. Again, kind of going back to Jacob's point as well. And he's changing the game, doing it for others, recognizing the interests of others. And that's ultimately as price center leaders, what we want to do is recognize our stewardship. Right? It's the roles that we play, but how we can do it in a way that's benefited from those people's problems. All right. Are you wondering if you have any other, like, are there staff for other groups? I'm just sharing how our like, I'm not going to miss the places. So I have done this at other schools as well. And I think the numbers are actually fairly small. I think more of a dimension. All right. So to summarize today, different sources of power, so being cognizant of those different sources, recognizing that both power and status divide influence, but for different reasons and with different effects. So yes, you're going to be in situations of power. But recognize that you also want to think about the needs and interests of others and gaining their respect, so that you can be more effective for them, as well as for yourself. And then politics are to be navigated, not ignored. So be aware you don't have to play the game, but you need to know that there is a game going on that you need to be aware of. All right. So next class, we're in a move on to speaking up effectively, so there is reading, the tactics reading, and then the managing up page. And then on Wednesday, you're learning from other readers' paper is due by 1.59 pm. And then next week we don't have class, we have coaching sessions. So I sent a email with a leave. Only one team member needs to find out your whole team does need to be able to come, make sure you sign up for a tinder entire team can come, and I'll send more information on that later this week. The other note on here by the end of this month, part two of your leadership development program or part two. And this requires getting feedback from other people who know it well. So if you look at the instructions for this leadership development part two, it has a script that you can email to people. So you need to get feedback from about three to five people. So start sending those emails out this week so that then you have enough time to put them link through them and put together your people. Any questions? Okay. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. I did, here's the crazy thing. One of the guys is mother and mother and mother. What? Right? Like in each other? Yeah. Yeah. So I was like, he's reviewing a lot. I was like, he's like, oh yeah. I'm like, not even really well here, really. And then everything that he interviews, he was just like, so I don't play this before. But on that, she's my mother in law. That's crazy. Yeah. So he asked her about me, which I was like, this is a crazy one for you. I was like, very similar. Yeah. So here's the thing. That was crazy. You guys were doing well. Here's the thing. So I first worked for her preschool. And then I was like, I need a year-round job. So I got to the point. She's like, can I actually like, help me with this percieve position? I said, don't force yourself to come into the closet. Just say, like, it's like, she's a mother. She's a mother, she ultimately didn't really get along, so she left. And the different thing is, when it's been a big day for me, I stay. She wanted me to come with her. And ultimately, it was a whole new thing. But I was really like, no, I think I need to stay. But we had done that. So I guess, she left when she is. And she tried really hard. But I'm like, I don't know what lasted. I didn't know what lasted. I didn't know what my wedding was. I said, you don't get it. So it's not my job. It wasn't my job. I mean, that's a whole time. That's not what you think. It's not my job. What is she going to say? Oh, yeah. I asked her for me because I brought her into it. I was like, I don't know. That's why my work was going on. So I don't know. That's crazy, dude. I'm really curious. Yeah, that's all the way down. That's just crazy. So. That's the answer. There's three. Also three. I look at your notes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You can actually try to understand. Let's do it. I know that you can be that right. And there's a need. It means that you can see it. It means that you can see it. Oh, yeah. That's a huge thing. I mean to apply to jobs. Dude, you two. I can't do it. You're not a single actor. I'm so much. I'm so high-pitched. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. I'm so low. Is anybody going to say that? I'm going to be nervous. I'm really nervous. It's way harder on the further you are knowing. It's a little bit harder. She went and thought it would end here. Okay, that was a situation to grow. For every movie. It was a very very loud. I'm so angry, honestly. I'm really nervous. I'm really nervous. I'm really nervous. It's for my first movie, if you take it, I feel like it's going to be a lot better. It's going to be a lot better. I'm like, I'm keeping everything right as far as like, he and she in the small family, but he and I have a different way of doing this. Like, for the moment, what was he supposed to do? It was because I was not video-experienced. That's the one. That's the one. Sorry, that's my face. I'm looking at what I can't bear with her. It's crazy. That's so much pressure. But I do like what these kids have like, at least. You know what I'm saying? It's nice to know what. Yeah, this is what I'm talking about. I'm like, what's wrong with her? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You know, literally every time other than her, it's not. It's just that person. Yeah, you guys stated this out on like 20 minutes. Like, they obviously had all these issues. I'm not going to have to. I'm just going to have to. Two of them. Two of them. Two of them. Two of them. I talked to them, but I'm waiting for them to get back to me. So I'm like, you know, talk to them. Like, it seems like all of our very church basically is what. They're in the lot of people. Uh, but they're gonna be the worst guys. She's like, another girl. The other girl in my intersection too. She worked at Nielsen. She thought with Ling for like, ever. And the reason she got docked four points, she got a 27. She got docked four points because she didn't have the percentage right next to her. Which is what they got docked you for, right? Yeah, but it's just not. It's not. Hers, I mean, but I was more value like legitimate because. She like had home because there was. What I'm saying, like, there is a dollar and mine was a measure of value. Yeah. And so I'm like, how do you put a percentage on like, I just evaluated your share. That I did put your. So now. You guys get on the leadership. What? You'll be the shit one. The favorite guys. No, which one, what did you guys get on the first one? Oh, I got 90. You already submitted your one for Wednesday. I like the question. I didn't mention it. What did you get? It was 93. It was 93. They're feedback. They have like the rubric and why you scored on each section of the rubric. Sorry. Description of life experience. The stories were connected to the state of convictions. We could have been structured as more of a story within our history. I don't feel like I had a gray on that paper. I was like, you're asking us to get straws. How long was the only issue one, the one that you just met at? Almost. That's like three and two thirds right now. That's kind of yeah. The only thing I think it might be, like the biggest gray or like part of the rubric is like a time and tear goal that you were being on. Wait what? That was like the highest part of the rubric."
