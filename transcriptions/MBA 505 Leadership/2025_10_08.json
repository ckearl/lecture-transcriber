  "text": "Right. Alright, we think that you'll Chairs celebrate Wednesday I can turn one. Yeah, okay. Somewhere on my wife's home. I'm sure it's one of those. Yes. One of those middle eastern eatery students that I've been treated before. I'm sure it's one of those middle eastern eatery students that I've been treated before. We have last week to listen to conference. We create a new year's advice. We have our years open to listen to the promptings of the spirit of us. We create a new setter. Moving on to our second day in the unit on the meeting in hierarchy. Today we're focusing on a senior. So how do we raise issues effectively and what to do with your employee is doing that as well? So our agenda for today, we're going to act quickly about employee voice, what it is, where it comes from, some of the agencies that you can see there, and then that I think you are amazing today. Alright, so voice comes from the study of how employees are likely to be caught when they're dissatisfied at work. This is first and spring work and he divides different employee behaviors along two dimensions. So this X-axis is destructive to constructive behaviors and then the Y-axis is active to passive behaviors. So if we start over in the passive destructive, these are behaviors that are harmful to the organization, but due to the employee basically not doing anything. So these are neglect behavior. So if you think about white quitting withdrawal, these are those kinds of behaviors. So employees are dissatisfied at work. They might just withdraw. As high as in to what we talked about last week, we talked about accountability. Are the behaviors that you're likely to notice and try and draw out why the employee is dissatisfied with withdrawal? On the active, the start good side is exit. So actual quitting, leaving the organization. This could also include sabotage behaviors as well. So actively trying to harm the organization. You see this in the bag of factory context in terms of damaging machinery. So actively trying to sabotage or exiting the organization. You can think of that being more destructive if they take clients with them. And then over on the passive constructive side, so loyalty is an interesting one. So employees make dissatisfied and just post that thing will get better. I'm going to stick it out. I'm going to keep doing my work. And I'm just going to hope things get better. So they're not actively trying to harm the organization. They are still doing their job and the whole way that things will get better. So loyalty is one response to dissatisfaction. The one that I focus more on is this active constructive behavior of course. So an employee might be dissatisfied and might see something that needs to be accrued. And so they're going to take it upon themselves to try and engage in behaviors that will lead to that change. So speaking up, trying to offer suggestions, thrive change that will benefit the organization. And could also benefit the employee and reduce dissatisfaction. So all of these quadrants are again responsive to dissatisfaction, differing in terms of how helpful or unhelpful they are to the organization and how active persons pass. So focusing in on employee voice, so the definition that I took to use is this discretionary communication of ideas, suggestions, concerns or opinions of the organization. So I think that's a good example of how to work related issues with the intent to improve the organization or unit. So two parts of this definition are one that is discretionary. So employees don't have to engage in voice. They could take that passive approach, just keep doing their job, helping that someone else will fix it and they'll do better. So engaging in voice behaviors is extra, usually outside the regular scope of your job. And then the second part of this is this intent to improve. So again, going on that constructive side. So the type of voice that I study is this idea of constructive voice. So actively engaging in behaviors by making suggestions or presenting ideas to change what's going on. And we call this a challenging behavior because you are trying to change the status quo. And the status quo is usually there because your boss put it there or it's been in the organization for a while. And so you're trying to challenge that status quo. To get a little bit more into the weed, we often talk about two different types of constructive voice. So one is promoted, focusing on improving for the future. And if you're going to engage in voice, this is the kind that I typically recommend, when you're offering suggestions about how we can improve the future solutions for doing that. And the contrast to that is prohibitive voice. And this is focused on correcting what's actually going on. You're often pointing to mistakes in the past and trying to correct them in the present. This framing of voice can be perceived more negatively because you're critiquing what has happened. I'm really focusing more on the past in the present instead of solutions for the future. So if you have to think about framing your voice, I recommend framing it in a promoted kind of frame, where we have the solution, opportunities, things we can do for the future. Questions about definitions of voice. So why speak up? Why do I study this? Because organizations benefit, so they can address employee concerns, improve the processes and procedures, the idea that from making changes based on voice, they can look better. For employees, there's also a benefit. So when employees engage in voice, their performance ratings are often higher, and supervisors will recognize and value their voice. In general, there's a positive relationship between speaking up and your performance rating. Obviously, they're better and worse ways to do that. So we'll focus on how to do it more effectively so that you can see that benefit for yourself. Why don't employees speak up? Because of the cost of the benefits. So if some of the risk to speaking up, it could damage your reputation. You could get labeled as a complainer or a curable maker. Your boss may be resistant to change and not want to hear what you have to say, because it can be threatening. Especially if you are suggesting ways of improving plans that they put into place. So it can be very threatening to them and their work. So it carries these definite risks. But another thing to think about is futility. So if you take on these risks and engage in these behaviors, it's a good matter at the end of the day. So if utility can have to do with whether your mentor is actually going to do anything with the voice, and then whether they actually can do anything. So they actually have the power to make the changes that you're suggesting. So risks and futility are usually what we talk about in terms of why employees may or may not choose to speak up. But it comes to futility. Some of my work has looked at who gets heard when they speak up. The public voice recognition. And what we found is that not all employees are recognized for voice. So racial and gender minorities in the organization are less likely to be heard when they speak up. And what's interesting here is the study that was conducted was in credit unions. And credit unions are predominantly female. So the organizations that we were in, the frontline lower level employees were 90% female. And then the CEO for one of the credit unions was a woman, the other one was a man. And what we found was that men were less likely to be heard because they were in the minority. So it has to do with the organization you're in and the majority of the minority. And the record of the minorities are less likely to be heard and they have left that minority in. We also found that newcomers and front timers are less likely to be heard. So my advice to you there, if you're going to go into your new job, you're going to have really great ideas, write them down. Write them down, give it probably two or three months, and then you start pitching your ideas. Because you come in and you start sharing your brilliant gems, they're just going to get buried and you're not going to get the benefit of it. So my advice there, write them down and then bring them up when you're no longer in newcomer. And then the other thing we found is that people that were on the periphery of the advice network, so those people that do their jobs, but they're not someone that other people go to for advice on how to do job, we're less likely to be heard. We also looked at whether people could make up for not being heard by speaking up more. And so this graph looks at so racial differences, so this blue line here are racial minorities and the red line are our Caucasians. And this why access is how much their supervisors recognize that they were speaking up, so how highly they rated the employees voice. And then this x-axis is how much the employee reported that they were speaking up. And so we see that for white employees when white employees report speaking up more, their supervisors recognize that they're speaking up more. So it's a tighter relationship versus for racial minorities, when they spoke up more, there was no difference in what type of support they were speaking up. So from a manager's point of view, just recognizing that you yourself may not be identifying all the ideas that minority group members are bringing to you, and you might have to be more active in recognizing those ideas and possibly seeing them out. So good reminder for Jack. Questions about this? So for the students who have studies elsewhere where there's a minority management with non-white and white-past employees. So we actually did look at that in the study to see if the match matters and we didn't find that match or mismatch matters. Okay, now what type is the article you guys have for today? So, the article doesn't call them tactics, but it's easier to read everything. It can make a new one in the device, so we're really making a new one in the device out of this. Okay, so the article that you had for today has several suggestions on how to make your voice more effective. So the tea here is tailored to the target. So this corresponds to the tamer in your pitch. So let's be advised for a tamer to the target. How do you get rid of your position? Okay, so understand your audience how they receive and want information. So tailor your pitch in the way that they are expecting it. The A, so activating appropriate affect, affect is number for emotions. So what does the advice when it came to emotion? Managing emotion. How do you manage emotions when it comes to feedback? The passion can be difficult to get attention, but it is fine that it shifts a bit. It's more often dismissed. Yeah, so it's the spine balance, right? You don't want to go in with anger because then it will be more likely to be dismissed, but you need to rock the boat a little bit and bring in those appropriate emotions to get attention. Tea is for consciously framed, so which is consciously framed referred to? So this is an article framing the issue. How do you frame it? Man, I really wanted to put it in the case, but basically it's like if you know what the organization is trying to do, what the attacker is trying to have, and you can say this new software, or a great example, is going to help us actually get this particular outcome, then that's the whole framing. But this is kind of like, oh, this thing is bad, it's not working. It's not relevant, but for a boss, I mean maybe, but I'm not really convinced that it's actually helping. Yeah, so tying it to the stripping objectives, the vision, what the fun of trying to accomplish. So I'll just be framing it in that way. Alright, the next tea is time, right? What do you mean by time frame? This is just saying that if you have something that you're wanting to change it, maybe you don't do it after something bad, and maybe do it after you hit some metrics or did something well, they're going to be in a better frame of mind to be more accepting of it. Okay, so making sure that there is a situation where they're open to it. Another part of this, you know? I think also what you're working with is the other side. If you're a long-winded, take a project and a tissue is going to work. So if your men are going to want you to do it, if you're a hard-to-swap, what if you have the band in it, then the more like this idea. Okay, so personal bandwidth and whether you can take on this project? I'd say also, you're terms of timing, like when in the day or the week you're doing that, it's Friday at four, like probably not the best idea to walk into a picture of a boss for any new ideas. But if it's like, oh, we have a one-on-one schedule at this day, 10 a.m., like that, that's the ideal. Okay, so you're thinking about it in terms of the week and where you're out there. I keep thinking about like budgets and stuff. Like if you had something to cost much of money, you went during budget season, the odds of it getting a copy are probably way higher than whatever they're reporting and having no money. Yeah, so what are the resources available? Yeah, no. You have a stakeholder, you know, is going to shut down the ideas and so wait for them to exit. You're in the day, you don't move during the department or something like that. Very strategic idea there, right? I'm thinking about the political angles of it. There was also an aspect of like trends and external things, like our other companies doing this, or like if you pitched AI like 10 years ago, everyone would have laughed at you, but if you haven't pitched it yet, like you're behind kind of. Yeah, so catching that way, right? So, you're recognizing what are other organizations doing, how do we, like if people are starting to get excited about it, that's the right time to jump in. So, great example of AI. Alright, the next one involving interested others, which is that's talked about this earlier. I was going back to the idea of coalitions, right? And involving other people to help you in this. So, building those coalitions, the next thing you consider a context, this has to do with norm. So, in hearing to norm, understanding like what are the expectations, how are people typically sell ideas, when do they usually do that, so being considerate of those things? And then the last one, which is the same, suggesting a sensible solution. So, specifically if you are looking for that performance benefit, coming in with a solution, rather than just the problem, is a great plan. Now, here's the caveat. Your solution doesn't necessarily have to be the one that's adopted, but if you come in with a viable solution and show a willingness to move around that solution, that's going to be the most effective for you and the organization. Because you don't necessarily have to have the right solution. You just need to bring in a solution to show that you thought about potential solution. So, that's really the idea. It doesn't have to be the one that's ultimately adopted or the right one, but one that could work and then you can negotiate around. Alright, so, we are going to jump in to case of Grace. Do what you guys think here. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. You can't hear. Learn workplace. It feels very minimal at workplace. Oh, using tactics. Not tactics. Like, great. She just said bad to deal with people. Don't know. She's trying to start strike and office. But, because of the kind of off-line, it feels like, hey, we, it's just like very implemented outwardly. Don't get me wrong all the way. But, yeah. Hey, I just want to, if you don't agree with me, I'll find another way to have you agree with me that way. Interesting, her perspective. I think it depends on the way you go. The more it is, I think a lot of the tactics that the people talked about is intended for you to go through like channels, and that's typically how you come into a community. There's a lot of people that come from your idea to go with somebody's head. You go and try to form a crew. Going into support partners. I get it by the, okay, I give this a problem. And I want to make sure I look at people. There's a problem that I'm not just understanding. And then, going to your boss, and I think the right way to leave this in the middle of the night, right, is your attempt at being beneficial, worked out, and going over or coming office and planning whatever to be to your boss, provided that you go through that problem. And I think here you read this interesting point, right, of like the degree. We talk about building a coalition, the importance of that. But tipping it too far is a coup, right? So, that balance. And I would also say, what are your intentions? So, is it to benefit the organization, right? Could you give us that question of whether it's manipulation? So, I personally think it was, I mean, you could bring it as manipulation, and I think it was more of a childishness. What do we think about Grace? Yes, because I don't think she even effectively did this act like when she was gathering her coalition. She basically just got a lot of junior employees to say, this is terrible software in the Navy. It didn't sound like she even talked to IT, who I think probably would have been a strong advocate. And all of this, with more or less of an issue, building this career, what she didn't even talk to her boss about, hey, where are some ways that you've seen that I could potentially grow? Okay, so really hitting the nail on that head there in terms of Grace's actions from the start. Back in question of manipulation, do you want to comment on the manipulation? Yeah, so for the least, I usually see you here from start with voice, it was long life. I have this idea, but I want to be the one who always make this position. So that objective for her was more like making care looks good, more like the... And I really appreciate this point, this question about manipulation, because as I'm teaching this to you, I want you all to be effective and take what we know about voice in order to be effective change agent. But there's that question, like obviously I'm telling you, this can benefit your career, because that's what I care about as your career. But my hope is that you use it to benefit the organization and you happen to benefit along the way. So that's a really great question to the eye, on the honest eye, has never really thought about it as manipulation, because I'm all about like bringing about change, it's gonna be good, so I really appreciate that. Thank you. Alright, let's jump into the case officially. And so Jen, I'm coming to you. Tell us what you think Grace's problem is in the blanket. That he didn't do what she wants. Okay, so if you're not doing what she wants, not... That's the thing. She's bad. According to her wishes, she's gonna have to go tell her back. Okay, hold her back. How does it look the biggest one? Okay, so holding her back, has it always been that way? She always does that way. No, I think honestly a big part of her issues is like she wants the growth, and suddenly she's like, she pitched herself in the way that she thinks she should grow and he didn't hear it. And so now she's just using his not helping her at all. And so it was just because of that one instance that like she shifted her the way that she saw him. Okay, so really identifying here that Grace... Her interest... how can I make sure? Did you get it? All right. What was she getting at the beginning from London? I learned to love her at the beginning. She wanted to support her, do everything I can to get my... you can't just help her. And I just remind me like a couple of days ago I have an interview with this company and they were just saying that while the biggest scare for a corporate America is someone who feels like they were she was stealing and they couldn't move away. And I think that happened to a long young ambitious people that when they really want to move up but then they really like... they don't satisfy with their work. I think that's very common for all people at basically. Exactly. And so we see at the beginning like she was very supportive and he was providing great mentorship. So helping her know what to do guiding her in that way and what we see is this shit. So Grace doesn't call it out but what she really wants after a certain point is this sponsorship. So it's less of being told like what to do and how to do it and more. How can you promote me? How can you make those connections for me? So especially as you guys think about your careers coming in, you know, looking for those mentors but as you feel like you have your feet on the ground and under you, looking for sponsors. And mentors can become sponsors but they're different to behavior. So something to keep in mind and you're thinking about your own career and that change in relationship. Because you might have to be explicit about it. I think it's important to note too that Landa kind of did stick with her the entire time. It was just she decided to frame it differently with like, oh, now he's not on my side. He's kind of an enemy now. It was just interesting that how, yeah, as soon as she didn't get what she wanted, it was like, oh, he doesn't like it anymore. He continued to meet with her, continued to give her feedback and criticism. You know, really helped the way I thought it was. But her perception changed. Which again, the power perceptions, right? It's also happening the same time like it does when she buys a few products through and gives her presentation to talk about how this other thing was played. But she doesn't recognize it all that while this might be important to him who wants to support it, he just doesn't have to be an enemy. Yeah. So we can see from grace that she is just not... Not aware of the play of the enemy. What if he's trying to get it? Yeah, David. He's also very impatient. You know, 15 months in an hour, you know, if you wanted to make lots of changes, that's actually not a lot of time, right? And then there's, depending on the culture, you might have to talk to many different stakeholders. You might have to get buy-in from multiple different units and for her to just want to push it through, it's very impatient, right? Not that it's a bad idea, but she has to take a different approach. She's 20, she's 20, she's not 80. Yeah, a lot of this is... You can make it into a vow. Okay, so Bailey, I think that's the GD's comment. She's also very emotional. Like, you can see throughout the needs, like she's kind of giving attitude, that was very unprofessional. She's like, she's so much at it. I think she's so much at it. Okay, so question of her emotions. I'm sorry. Yeah, I was just saying, as time goes by, it's a part of the reason that people don't know if she doesn't if she's looking at you. Okay, let's joke into the tactics. Okay. So, if we start at the top, how would she do in terms of tailoring to the target? Of course she should. Terrible, what made it so terrible? She allowed for zero context in terms of the situation that he is you should in by her coming to him with this effect. An expectation that your boss is going to do the thing that you suggest, what like yes, significantly more experience is in a position where if you would forward with something like this and it got shot down, it would be far more possible if you were in this room or where she is only ever aware of it. And it didn't know what you thought. Okay, so not very sometimes the situation is in, yeah. I sure like to see also being a consultant and treated it like a consultant where you have someone who's come to you to ask for help with this. Whereas, that's not the case with this. She's just like, here's this problem. I don't want to take it on. But she doesn't frame it in that. She doesn't tail her in that way. If you tail her as if she's a consultant with a client and that sort of thing. Okay, so even ask the land of the ask for this solution. So, she's not interested in this problem. So, you think about tailoring it, right? Because problem isn't something that you just didn't read. I think I kind of want to push back on down because I feel like when you're just because someone even, even if someone has a problem, if you don't store your knowledge and you don't present something to them and you're really framing it, it's really hard to get buy-in from an organization on changing the way things are. Especially when you're, you know, doing consulting like if you're, you have a core team that understands issues, but you have a lot of affected teams. And you have to find ways to tailor solutions to not just like, you know, an organization general, but to the different areas of an organization. So, for the software, I don't know. I don't remember if it even mentioned it, but I don't know who's primarily using this case. I know she talked with a bunch of other junior people about this. I.T. owns it, right? And assuming upper management uses well, but people probably use it different levels and different degrees. So knowing that you kind of need to get buy-in from the different groups on, and perspectives from different groups on how they use it and then be able to frame the benefits to those groups. Yeah. So, how does the user, how does it affect him, right? I think it's tails-in with the ones that you like. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'm just saying that she should know this if she's doing consulting. Like, she should know that you can't just like say, this is the solution. Not a very abstract, if she's old, right? Yeah. That's the only thing. Very nice. All right. I think that. I thought you were going to say that you have just said you were pregnant. It does say that she, she is from people all of us, and they should know that they're struggling with this software. And so, you know, she does do it some more of the understanding, not just for the previous issues, but for people like the Boston even the Boston Boston, right? If anything, it gives you that confidence to go past your Boston even more. So, I think it's less of an issue of not necessarily thinking how it might affect the Boston's particular issue, but it's completely perspective of us, it's going to be a bit of a need rather than trying to help solve the his issue. Right. So, she's not connecting it to his issues. It's more about her. Yeah, exactly. All right. So, we have the team, so tailoring to the target, what about the appropriate affect? So, started to come and get into that idea. I can't remember you were starting to talk about. I was going to talk about it in the hours. Okay, so we'll wait and figure it to the north. Okay, affect. I don't know how I'd feel if I was at a company party, like trying to enjoy my time, and I see my junior employee talking to my manager about, like, I'm like, when I probably know what she's talking about, I think that's like embarrassing. Okay. Okay. So, essentially, ignore, plan is, feeling about the situation. So, just pushing right past them is one of it. There's just that. Demotions of lack of a remote control with a client and she's stressed. She's like, oh, I have a project that's more important right now. I guess you're more curious. Yeah. I'm a little more curious. There's a lot of people talking to my client. I think I remember it's in there. It's the last news they have in terms of, she's like, I can tell, I see Hagrid, I can get to the shovel. She doesn't even notice that. It just gets super mad. So, it feels like she's unable to see past her own reactions. The thing is, well, manage how she's feeling. It moves out to the actual things. Okay. So, lack of emotional regulation. Some lack of awareness. Just a... Yeah, that's... Simply through that last interaction. It's like, and then I think next you did a good job of recognizing that, like, well, this is getting really emotional. It's like a break. Yeah. And then she goes straight to her email. And I think... She's been with Pia, she's not send it. And I'm like, I feel like my number one rule is never send it. Email when I'm feeling emotional. Write it out. Yeah, that makes me feel that it's like care be to write out that. And then emotional email. And then not send it. Don't put it in place. Don't put it in place. Don't put it in place. Don't put it in place. Don't put it in place. I do have the wall. I do have the wall. You don't have to write it in place. I have the wall. That's just good. I think it's hard to be able to send it. And she should extract it. And then I'll give it all her stupidity. I think hopefully she's... She really can't have it. She probably is. Yeah, I'll just... Maybe I'll just... Sorry, I'm sorry. I think she's having emotional. And then you may be the baby during the weekend. She's like the emotion you're conveying there was like desperation. Hey, baby. She's like, I think it was good for her anything. Yeah. But right. She's just all these things. She seems... She seems... She feels satisfied after sending those things. She's had these actually people on the mic. You know, she thought you're not good. It wasn't a good strategy. You said you know, other people can't do it. Yeah, so how will other people interpret it? There's a big more aware of how others will interpret it. My favorite... Go back to the company party. My favorite part is like, I actually completely mess in terms of the support of her. Yeah. Like her... He was like, yeah, her baby... He was like, yeah, her baby... And Grace took that as like holy cow. He's like, holy back in my idea. He's doing stuff. Yeah, he's gonna be on my side. So suddenly like, you know, she thinks that she can like skip the chain of domestic issues. She talked to somebody at a company party that was like less than enthusiastic about her idea. Yeah. So again, showing how important that emotional intelligence is being able to read people and their reaction is really important. Okay, let's move on to C. So consciously framing the issue. Did she consciously break it? There was no clear connection between her kids, Sharon. This is cool. This is a strategy. It's also really tough for you. The second hand embarrassment is really hard to break it. Yes, no connection. It's just strategy. Yeah. This stuff's a... It feels like a personal thing. Because over here it says like, she write on like several key points to make strong case and she's sending it to like, I don't get it about it. But it feels more like her personal gains than like, she won't fully try. Yeah, I'm going back to that. I mentioned Grace earlier about manipulation. Right? This seems more manipulative than benefiting the organization because she is focused on that personal gain. Right? So that's her framing for it. And it's not exactly hidden. I think just going out to that, I don't know that she's openly telling other people like, this is going to be really great for me. But I think it's just leading through in the way that she's approaching it. So even though like, I think you're probably trying to tell people, hey, this is going to be a good product company. But it's clear that that's not her actual key point. Okay. Maybe she could fit her up a whole presentation with, I don't know what it's like, the graphs and then data. So she did these attempting some connection to the overall good. But like I was saying, you can tell it's about her. And it's not, she's not going to sit on the conflict. And all this might be a good thing. I mean, just a game time. But it's not what's going on in the business around. It's only that. Okay. So let's go to timing. That's the next one. So timing seems off, right? It's not just going to be the overall. Yeah. So not considering the priorities, not considering... The interests of others, right? So, having ties in is not writing away a thing. She should have called up the executive guy home and talked to him at home. Yes, I'm sure that would have been... She could have had a poor isolated. We also talked about her being really new, which is about the day. But she's also been making mistakes throughout her entire first decade of life. And then she's multiple times away and has given her a raise. And so she feels like she needs to make up with big challenges in the midst of her naive of being. I live here in her old job. She's not coming from a position of certain kids. Yeah, hard to get her to explore the town on all the tactics. I think this would be a good move. Yeah. I'm sort of like... I'm feeding up the salesperson that finds an uninterested customer and gives them the long version of the pitch. Or like by little siblings coming home after a curfew of asking for a longer curfew. She obviously isn't like testing the waters enough to life. Figure out when the right time to give that pitch would be. It's like looking at the comments you know we're talking some of the quality. Definitely missing a lot of those. One of the things that can be said to me is I don't fully agree with this idea of attaching yourself... Attaching your promotion to the thing that you try to push in the company. For me, I very deliberately avoid my own performance being tied to the thing that I'm doing. I think this is going to improve on the scenes. I want my full of sweeping, so my execution, not whether or not the company is in this state. And that raises a really good point. Like I said at the beginning, engaging in voice behaviors is discretionary and should be extra role. So it shouldn't be directly tied. Like I'm going to speak up so I give a promotion. It should be distinct. And it goes back to those interests and which interests are you pushing. That's going to show interest. Alright, so now let's go to the context. So... The moment I see a nice, good ballerina. You won't be the only one. No, I'm not. I'm talking Diego. She, you're a little bit more bad. Yeah. Maybe not right people. Okay, so she's got the junior employees on board, right? No, she can't. Yeah. She got their junior employees on board. What did she need to get on board? She was like, oh this seems like, you know, this Baltimore and her IIT. Maybe she should have that when you said, oh you might have thought about this. So you wouldn't get so much easier to just get on board with getting together. You shouldn't have the letter. Yeah, where do you want to make the letter? Don't talk to IIT. Okay, so she's building a coalition but not necessarily of the right people. So that creates problem with that. Alright, now we get to the speed. So thinking about the context. So you were going to say about the norms. Yeah, just kind of like, I feel like law is going to jump to the norms. Like she's not reading the room. She ends up not being in games. Yeah, she's just selling her own games in her face. And we see that in a lot of ways with some of these other tactics, right? Like the timing, the fact that she's new and has made mistakes, right? Other ways that she wasn't bothering the norms. Well, it's not really answering that. But in general, she's not aware of the norm because her intention was to get promoted so that she can like advance. However, if she knew what's your reading room and get that point where she gets bullied, she should connect with Anna and understand their misunderstanding and adjust into that. And that way she doesn't understand the context of how she can benefit land and mass-emmanager and in that way. So again, pointing to some of these norms relates to the other tactics. And what does it like? I think this creates not only not aware, but she was looked for confirmation bias to her. Yes. So like she was in different kind of, only a polite answer from her TV. And that super-disasseted question, which was like looking for a way that they would support her. And normally, from me, that was actually... Okay. So she's reading things the way she wants to read them in a very biased way. I think going back to last lesson of the politics, I just don't actually know how this is work. Like the social parts of this is work, right? Where there's, you can have a great idea, but if you're not, if you're not flowing with the social, that you don't actually know. Like if you're not being politically correct about it within the workplace and within the culture of your workplace, you're never going to get anywhere. And you're never going to get promoted because you know what, you could do all the good work in the world. But if you're not, you don't have a high level of EQ or good enough social awareness of what around you, you're never going to get. It's interesting, too, because we see London like trying to gently show her those social expectations, like coming over and like changing the topic to a movie, right? Something not work-related, kind of suggesting to her, like this is what this time is for, but maybe he needed to be. And we'll probably help you get further, right? Like if he did it. Yeah. I think that the fact that she and the MOL-IT show that she didn't understand the organic organization, the culture and the formal organization. Yeah. Yeah. So thinking about that formal structure, right, you guys talked about how the informal and the formal should fit together, right? So our culture is that this is something that belongs to IT. You know, that's part of our formal structure as well. Yeah. So we're going back to the honest center here. She's got three separate channels within that. A little bit of a chart. She's going directly to the making of the Shishankini. She should be playing with her own specific. Yeah. She's considered just going about learning how to send in the middle, start sending in the community. Yeah. That's just very different. I think Atlanta comes in and tries to color like your skipping level, this is how you should do it. So definitely not following the norms of the fact. That would look good. All right. Sorry, this is just what I remember when she said that. She also said something multiple emails back to back to back. Oh, I want to send it. After telling her she went orange, it seems to me to crack out. It's a very, like Charming pointed out as well. Like it sounds a little desperate. Like why are you doing this? Yeah. Not the way that you think it is. Back in my college, what is my after-brand? There was a lot of student-run political movements. And they looked kind of often to the classes to teach their ideas and stuff. Then engineers were like, not as welcoming to them. So everything knocked it out. People just like, oh, yeah, again. I think that's how people start seeing grace. Yeah. Just somebody like, she comes, talk to people like, oh, she's kidding. So she begins like just this over and over and over. So she's creating a reputation, right? But she doesn't realize what that recognition is. But her's going to the norm. Like she was doing it to have recognition. So that she would be included in the next big project. And like she thinks maybe she doesn't understand. She actually have to be endorsed. She is a project that would never become more of this. Or like she said, it would open up or whatever. She's like that, but like, that should be the one that she's looking for. Or on there to get this sponsorship to be endorsed about the project. That would let it get her to be married or like a whole project. So understanding the norms of what it takes to receive that endorsement and part of that project. She's clearly ignoring those as well. Is it always good to fall in the norm? Sorry, I'm up today having a very challenging. I can't remember exactly what that story is. Like you want to keep on holding a fish a lot of people like that you will, whatever it is there, it's like, it's going up in the water and then keep them alive. And in the office that I'm going to, like, have a social norm, nobody speaks up, the whole office is dead, nothing's moving forward. I want to be the one that throws up the water to like, hey, everybody get up. Is it always good for the norm or is it? I love the pictures you have on your face. It goes back to the manner in which you do it. I think for sure you can stir up stuff and it's what she's trying to do. That's like, if you look at Grace's side, she's like, well, I'm trying to know and change it. But it's the matter in which you do it. You have to follow some of the processes or some of the social norms that are in place in order to do that. You will get further ahead if you say, okay, I want to make change, but tactfully, I have to be able to connect with these people who actually can make the change in order to make change. I can move you to the loop. A little, yes. Follow some of their expectations to break the other expectations. I have a long time for what we've been saying. It's, it's, it's, you know what your circle is? And you should always, you should understand that. But if I, I can visually consider the circumstances, just about the direction that you use. You can go it. And like, to be the level of the relationship, like, I am trying to expand some. I'm going to go work on these people's here and over here, but it's like, framing it and using it. I want to make change so that the full office is changed and also I can get the board in there. Well, I think building out the analogy, right? To heal, stirs things up to benefit the fish, right? So that same idea of like, I'm doing this supposed to benefit many people. Stuart. Well, this makes me think a lot of, and if you've seen the TV show among, but it has this interesting relationship with a therapist, a doctor, a crewer, and any time there is something that prevents him from being able to meet with Dr. Gurkhan. He comes up to an crazy solution. So like, oh, I'll just visit you at your house or whatever it is that, and it breaks those norms. But I think that's kind of, I guess, where we're going to go to the last, the asset, like, sensible solution. To have, like, to put the sense into this solution, you have to be doing all of the other steps. And so, yes, you want to have certain things up. But if it doesn't make sense, if it's not the, you're not solving the basic norms of basic, kind of, I guess, things that you have to buy into to just be relevant, then you're never going to benefit the rest of the crew. Okay, good point. Ben, and then we're going to have to go. Okay, I, some of us, the manipulation thing concerns about, kind of, how to get yourself, like, dirty and less, like, fuel the menu. I don't know, it was, it reminded me of the scriptures. And I don't know if the word is exactly, but it's the, he has wisest circumstances, but it's harmless to studge, like, having good intentions, being able to work within the context. But ultimately, doing it pretty good, not necessarily self-interest. Yeah, great, great reminders. And let's build on this idea. So, thinking about ourselves as Christ-centered leaders, I want to do a roleplay. So, get into a pair. One of you will be landed. One of you will be graced. And those who are graced, fully be great. You have our permission to be great. Does land, I want you to think as a Christ-centered leader, how do you approach the situation with grace in a way that is going to, to positive outcomes? So, go ahead, partner, and they'll have about five minutes. So, your cup bag is in your bag. I'm going to try to drink with them. And, how do you like them? I don't know if they're fine. What is the color of these? Yeah, they're still high. We could prank over pearls today. All right, all right, all right. Oh, so, I've had a lot of time, I think, I don't know. I think I've had a lot of relationships with God. I like to just be so glad even on this trip. I think so. I think so. I really want to know what you're going to do. I know. I know. You can do the Christmas Eve. I already don't want to make it. I'm going to do something big later. Well, great. All right. All right. I'm going to have a little ride. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. You're probably not. When I told you no, did you say that maybe it was about time is for the year you and Zelda. I expressed to you that now is not the time for this because of X-Wine. But we put in pre-pinsies that I came with and I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. Look, what do you think my outfit is? Look, look. Look, look, look. Are you going to be a prank? No, look, I'm going to be a prank. I'm going to be a prank. Maybe we need to kind of wait a few more minutes. I think part of it is that there's a big project looking at some of the new dollars. I know a lot of us probably have been watching this. I know what I want to be and see how that's going to be. I see how it would make that. Oh, I don't see anything. I'm trying to do it with the actual door head. I don't know what I can do. I don't know what I can do. I feel like if she had the email, I feel like I'm pretty good. I feel like I'm feeling a long time right now. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. I feel like I'm going to be a prank. We're going to work on this together, inviting in some ways. I just think back to our lesson class on the topic of the interactive listening. Maybe that's the first step. Make sure to embrace it. It's a true field of confidence. It's a true field of confidence. Let's help her realize that if this is your goal, you're going in the opposite direction. Let's bring it around. Let's bring it in the context of her goal. This is the same principle. It's the same principle. It's the same principle. It's the same principle. It's the same principle. It's the same principle. It's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. I think that's the same principle. Another big thing when we're going to roleplay that comes to my mind was the reading about how to manage people to make excuses. I felt like she has motivation. There is no alignment and the confidence is struggling because of that lack of alignment. She's basically putting the card for the horse and trying to promote her. She's able to do the job basically. What is your goal? This is my goal for you as we be aligned and bring you back together for the release of the stage to go on from there. Bring that alignment forward and showing where there's misalignment and trying to get back on track. I think he and Brave as Lana really went. Lana needs to achieve that grace, understanding she's failing in the way that she's managing the situation. If he didn't achieve this, he's not going to be able to avoid this situation in the future. Making it that learning opportunity. The awareness plus learning to avoid similar situations in the future. Do I see her now? I was listening to Alan and I thought Alex and he knew it. It was kind of like an emotional DTR basically. So find my relationship. Maybe it's not to this point yet, but maybe I don't want to meet some of her. She's like, hey, this is not working. We've tried to tell you a lot. You know, cross your lines. Maybe you need to go through the junior and for the data for this client for a few months. And then we can talk about the one-tricks project. I think anybody who needs the consequences that Alex and BigHenry are continuing. Okay, so pointing out those possible consequences for the behavior as it is. Along with that, I've risen up to being fired because of the race. But here's the thing. Point out the possible consequences. You are storing a U.S. stirring up water. You are making everybody complaining. The manager is not happy. I had the mental pullout past 50 months. I'm not happy. You have more than the vice of the VP at party where you can just kind of enjoy it. It's not good. So I won't get behind your idea, but you're not giving me enough reason to believe in the United States. Okay, so relationships are part of that. And also I do you say her reputation. I guess what is she building an education for? I just sometimes wonder that maybe in the main humility we show a little bit too much grace. I don't know if that's the right word because I mean, he's great suspicion for everything. But I do think that sometimes you have to be like, yo girl. Like you are like, you're real bad. Yeah. And the organization, like, can she not understand something? You just have to tell her what the implications of her actions are because it's kind of going to the last class. She doesn't understand there's this game that's being played. So it's educating her on the game and she doesn't get out that point that I'm like, well, you're only going to sink. So creating that awareness for her for the learning and also creating awareness of the comfortable people. So I feel like I was like less bothered by grace than most people that are this case. Because I never heard of you like a little and we, but like, it didn't, I don't know. I feel like I worked with people like this and I've never been that big of a deal. He's kind of like, let them do their thing. And that one happened, bro. They just keep doing it. And they're not the happens. And like, you're much better than them. But like, I don't know, I've been like there are people like this is an organization. But yeah, so we had like a much gentler talk, right? Sure. And like I suggested that we go to IT and like having interactive people like this is like, there's probably already a solution to this problem as you just don't know about. So let's go have them tell you what it is and like this will subside or come on to whatever and tell you the thing. So still trying to help with awareness, but also on your side of the manager. Like, I still think that's serious. It's not that big. All right. I'm going to move this on. So some definite feelings about grace and what she did and a lot of the things that she misread. And didn't quite pick up on and the learning experience for us. I think it's just a great experience. I think it's just a great experience. All right. So the last thing I wanted to talk about in this section on voice is another approach you can take. So this is for my own research and this idea of using an advocate. So specifically when you have concerns that you want to raise, it's very effective to have someone else speak up on your behalf. So in research that I did with our title data as well as experiments, we found that having someone else speak up about concerns leads managers to be more likely to take action. Because when you have an advocate speak up on your behalf, they see that advocate as engaging in pro-social behaviors wanting to help either you or the organization and some managers are more likely to take action. And they also think well if this advocate is concerned about this issue, then maybe I should be as well as some social proof there. So if you feel like your concerns are not being heard or may not be heard in the best way, think about having an advocate speak up on your behalf. All right. And the last thing I wanted to kind of do our summary, right? So many ways employees respond to satisfaction, destructive constructive, active, and passive. Employee voice is that discretionary, extra role behavior that can suggest changes for the future. So that's a motive. We're trying to address problems and concerns which is that prohibitive using the tactics to speak up effectively and then thinking about an advocate. Our reflection for today, now that you've learned these tactics, what are ways that you think you could be more effective speaking up in the future? Did she send the email? I don't know. How many of you guys think she said that? Oh, she definitely said that. Oh, she definitely said that. Give us a round of applause. I like it. You're really good. Who was that? You guys get down. You can't get down. You have to like the phone. Don't shoot it. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm trying to strive for it. Thank you. I'll wait one for you. Thank you. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. I'm the best. All right. So Corbin asked how you be an advocate, my book. So in other research, I've done usually a bit of a blanket asked to advocate those that have higher status in the team. So it might be because they're better connected to other people or they have more expertise or they're central in that advice network. Some of the other people go to. So if you go to those higher status people and like say, hey, I have this concern. Chances are they probably will take it on and champion it. So you can ask them directly or ask for advice of how they might suggest about it. And they might volunteer in that way as what we think. So usually literally what people write. There are people that do kind of volunteer for these advocate kind of goals. I was a proper example of my last company in the senior at IPNA. He has a one-do IPNA and then he figured out a way. But since he's more grace trying to do, but he's very charismatic. He talked to G.A. by Eda. And then he called against C.F.O. with his boss. But then because I had G.A. by Chapman, Eda back him up, now he's the director of business development in my company. Which that president I mean doesn't even exist before that. So he figured out a way to be a successful user pilot game to get a position that he wanted. He lost his job so much more than doing that via network. I'm very impressed by what he did. That's a great example. So finding those people that have that high status that you can kind of go to as a promised all day with head coach. Okay, the last thing I wanted to mention. So you're learning from other leaders paper is due tonight. So Nathan did put more detail into the room. I do want to clarify that the expectations do not change. He just increased the transparency. So the expectations are still the same as they were before. There's just more predatory in terms of what to score than we would when you get that. So criteria are the same. Assignment is the same. You don't have to change anything. There's just more transparency. I don't know if that was the goal of that. Next week we have team coaching so we will not have class because we know that we're going to take a place of class. Most teams have signed up. There's still a few teams that haven't. So look for that link. I'll reset it as well that you should have received it last Friday. We're one person from your team news design up. And then we'll meet in the conference room once we're on the floor up here. And then you reflect the best self as I mentioned on Monday. So this requires you to get feedback from probably about five people in your life across broad areas of your life. So it can be family friends, coworkers, managers, your record courts, trying to get a broad picture. There's a script you can use to send an email. The questions that you need to ask them, then you'll reflect on it, bring it back together, and that'll be due at the end of the month. Any questions?"
