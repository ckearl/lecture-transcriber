  "text": "that you need to take. Take it from last day and immediately put it into a bag. So we're going to give you some time to practice and really work on your skills. So that's what we're going to spend the most of our time on. So as we jump in, you have had an article to read for today about listening. So listening involves attention, comprehension, and relation. All right, so John, you've come from the coming to you. What were some of the main points you took out of art? One of the main things for me was suspending judgment and as well as the emotional part of it. When you listen to somebody, ensuring that you're not cheating you the way that they're talking to you by making a feel, like if you're not open to it, they all want to talk about it, should they? Yeah, three points. So listening and making sure that your questions are open. OK, so suspending judgment, how do you work on that? So it's really easy to where somebody says something and immediately put your values and your beliefs into what they say. And then that's completely changes the frame of the conversation and it's considered to be your perspective and your judgment as a host of us. Right, so oftentimes we're trying to understand it from our own perspective rather than listening and hearing them as well as figuring them what we think about what they're saying. OK, anything else other people thought of? The one thing that I thought was really interesting is that asking questions in the middle of conversation is actually a way of misdirecting what they're trying to say. I really thought asking questions was showing that I engaged and interested in what they're saying but you know what I'm not sure if it's that interesting. It comes on the question, sure. Yes, we'll practice today. So can guys have a conversation for sure? And I'm talking about this before, because I struggled with that savings I had paying. I thought that was what was to be interesting. You have to be interested in what that's kind of what a lot of my family members say. But even just as simple to say like, like, explain yourself again, you know. Let them continue to dig instead of you having to clarify or ask other questions. There's just another device that I've never thought about that. Yeah, great point. So be careful about those questions, reason. Don't talk about yourself or how to relate to you or anything of that nature. I can catch myself to say that quite often. I'm really quite often. But I'm like, oh, yes, I feel the same. I'm like, oh, no, no, you would say that to one. God, it is not. Okay, so two points there, right? Like, when it is really hard not to try and relate, but two, also recognizing that active listening is a skill like it talks about, you know, both of the sudden when to use it. So sometimes in relationship, the way you do want to show, oh, yeah, I kind of make sure you're something similar, right? So showing that you can relate but being more open to what they're saying. So watching that a little bit more. I really like how it talked about like, you have to reflect what they're saying, but it's like you're finding the balance between not doing it at all and then doing it like, just repeating exactly what you say, but you have to get like the content and an emotion in a way that shows that you were listening, but like not just following exactly what they were saying. Exactly. So not parroting back exactly what they said, but trying to find that emotion, maybe through words that they didn't exactly say. Yeah, I, going all the way back, I thought I was pretty good listener until, until this, this like, article, I was like, maybe I'm pretty sure enough people like, one maybe one pop still one, exactly what he said, maybe I'm just parody. But it's kind of hard because when somebody talked about something, you hear the keyword, who like, oh, I can contribute to that thought and then you just so caught up in your own world and then you're like, wait a minute. I don't remember half of what he said, but I think from my perspective, this is what I think I'm in this caught up in that cycle. Great insight of like how you can get caught up and aren't actually listening to that. That's what I think we are. Yeah, also, you know, like we said that and we get to know the words, but actually the emotion that we should be more attention to, because usually the people that we are listening to, they try to articulate and divorce on one, they are actually experienced. And that's usually the struggle that they talk about. And that especially maybe when it's like different languages and both, unless you meaning between certain words, that's even more, we should focus more on that emotion aspect. Yeah, really great point. So digging underneath the words to figure out what's going on. I just really like the line in it that it's because you don't always know what they think of the old. And to me that felt like, it's like a super song right at it. It's kind of like almost like old school photography. You just gotta let it develop, like just like sit back and like, any way you can help it develop this great, but you're not, you don't wanna change the picture before you see it. You wanna know what it is, kind of stuff. That's a great analogy. I really like that. All right, that was a little confusing. I really like what it said about following instead of leading. I've come to realize that a lot of my form of active listening is I'll listen and I'll ask questions here to where the specific end that I'm anticipating. And so then as I've read that, I'm like, oh, I need to ask questions in a different way by else, I need to not train here. If I'm like, oh, they're talking about this issue that I like to solve where I'm gonna help them get to that point. And you just allow them to lead at themselves instead of trying to get to that point that I'm imposing on. Yeah. Which is a really great book because often we have training, we have like you're getting in a VA. You have education, you have knowledge. And often we want to share that with people and do it in this way of like, and I ask them questions to get them here that may not actually be where they need to go. So if you're gonna say, I was gonna add to the Stuart point. Somebody told me a few years ago that 70% of the problem solving is done out loud. And that changed my whole approach to light most things, including patients with myself. And I don't know if that's true. Like I did very bad situations. But even if it's a small percentage of that, like you're the person you're talking to, you have some best and anxious thing in some way. And so like if they're trying to work through something, like practicing the bad things, it's literally helping them problem solve something in their life. And you only have to contribute like presence. Yep. Just by being there, great insight. All right, so I think we hit most of these points, right? Non-judgmental, respectful, reflective, empathetic kind of getting to that, you know, understanding motions underneath. So using our listening in a slightly different way than often we have in the past. One thing that is interesting here, and I'm coming to Anna for this question. So it talks about good listening as a way of being influential. What thoughts do you have about that? How does that work? Yeah, I think that one of the most influential things about active listening is those trusted people. And then more trusted people, who do you have with them, and more likely who are to have influence on them, who are to do it and speak. Yeah, patients that have a lot of help, you can't always have to go back to some point where you are, and you can't even have a conversation. But when you take the time to actively listen to that, then you can really do something, and offer advice, or to thank you for your questions. They're about to have a lot of work to do. So you. Yeah, doors open, right? You've listened to them, and now they can also be prepared to listen to your point. Any other thoughts about the influence? I'm here to book and I just put the difference. I've heard it. I have not read it. Long one, my favorite, so I'm not having a lot of this point in there about what's influential is that active listening quite the voices there. So for our conversation, both thinking different things and when that you feel understood and heard by someone, then it's easier to then hear them because all the thoughts you had are now out. Their mind's clear. And you're open to hearing your own benefits. It's almost like you're decluttering your head so they're open to something. Yeah, but then another great visualization of what the effects are. Monty and Dr. Monty. I think the case of it is the fact that oftentimes we easily dismiss people that we trucked up half of the whole picture, right? If I'm talking to somebody, and I give them a piece of it, then they try to offer their device. It might have probably going to be a little bit like, OK, but you'll really understand what's going on here. Whereas if you will bother yourself with the impact of the active listening piece, a lot of that for that person to assume that you actually have sufficient context that you can offer good advice and that you have, you know, some will be made to your state. And it makes it all that much easier to actually have an effect on what you're saying. Yeah, another great point. Like, put out all the pieces and now they're open to hearing what you could offer. I like what I've talked about since the beginning. I'm sure now, you're just easier than you're going to feel when you're doing it. So in terms of like influencing people, even if you're just trying to apply the framework, and you're not allowed to be sincere about it, so they're just not feeling the same. Yeah. And that's another great point, too, is it points out that active listening can be manipulative if you're not sincere. So be mindful of that as well. Yeah. Yeah, I think this was a challenge when you're a leader, because some nice people are doing for validation or with donations, how to use something. So it's violence between active reasoning and actually, I guess, things that you can't actually feel. Yeah, great point. OK, we're going to move on. So in terms of, we know a little bit about what good listening is, what good listening is not. So some of these might look familiar in terms of people you've interacted with or make the situations you found yourself behaving in. So the figure, they look like they're listening, they're smiling, they're nodding, they're thinking about something entirely different. I will admit that sometimes with my five-year-old, this might happen. They're telling you this amazing story and they're like, OK, so not really listening. The interpreter, so I think this kind of goes to Alan Comet earlier. You know, they're listening a little bit, but they see where this is going. Or think that they know where this is going. And so try to get to that spot instead of letting the person figure out for themselves. You're just trying to get them to that spot. The intellectual, and I think many of us fall into this trap as well, which in some ways, we're training you to do, right? Like you're supposed to be looking for patterns listening for those key facts and trying to make sense of this puzzle. But the problem here is if we're trying to put that puzzle together, we're not letting the other person actually do that themselves. And so again, there's a time and a flight to search for those patterns and put that puzzle together, depending on what you need to get out of the conversation, it might not be the right time. So again, this can be very effective, but may not be the right time. The Fisher, often we do this when we are networking, right? Trying to build those relationships, you know, hearing enough to be able to comment ourselves kind of creating, you know, that situation where we want to show that we're interesting rather than interested, right? So taking us a step back there. The rebuttal maker, so I'm sure you guys have encountered people like this that are just coming forward by, they're going to listen enough so that they can rebut what you're trying to say. And then the advice giver. So just trying to offer solutions, again, kind of to what you said, listen to enough where they're like, oh, I've got a solution to this problem without actually hearing the entire problem. So again, these are things that we often fall into and just being more mindful that when we are doing these things, we're not actually listening. We're trying to either solve the problem or move the conversation in a certain way. So why are we talking about this in the leadership class? It's because, be a good listener, affects how people see you as a leader. So this is a meta-analysis where they take findings from a bunch of studies and combine them together and then look at the relationships and the strength of relationships between the different things. And so this K here is the number of studies. So how many studies tested these relationships? And then this row over here is the relationship. So it goes between negative one and one. So bigger numbers indicate a stronger relationship. So we see that when employees believe that they are being listened to, that their leader is a good listener, they also rate that leader higher on leadership skills. So being a good leader. So listening to your people has a very strong effect. People that feel heard or listened to also report greater job satisfaction. So considerably strong relationship there. Going to Anna's point about trust. They're more likely to trust people when they feel listened to you. When they feel like they have people that listen to them, their less likely to feel burnt out at work. So feel like they have the resources that they need. They feel safer. So in terms of being able to make mistakes and be open about who they are. And then this last one, they looked at patient satisfaction. So patients who felt their doctors listened to them were more satisfied. So some considerable effect of listening. And to put it into perspective, I wanted to show you a relationship between job satisfaction and pay. We figure that pay is one of the biggest things. That relationship is only 0.15. So it explains 2.25% of job satisfaction. In contrast to that, feeling that you're listened to is like 27% of variance in job satisfaction. So a huge difference there. Pay is like this much. Feeling like you're listening to it explains a lot. So obviously, listening does take time. It doesn't take time any time is money. But the point of this is to show that it can have a big effect. So as you think about leaving other people and focusing on listening, it is going to make a difference for the people that you're managing. All right, now it's time to practice. So you're going to get impaired. So you're going to stay with the same person through all of our rounds. So we have essentially four rounds. So we're going to do a practice round first just to warm up a little bit. The rule is that when one person speaks, the other person only listens. Cannot say anything, cannot ask anything. Only listens. And then you'll switch. So we'll do a warm up round first. And again, when one person speaks, the partner should only listen. Some silence is expected, pushed through it. It will be uncomfortable. So just embrace it. It's going to be a little uncomfortable that it'll be worth it. And so you want to pay attention to what your partner says and what you say when it's your turn, and then when we're left on an afterwards. Any questions?  And we'll solve this in a minute. This is the way you're going to use a started. And with that. So kind of recognizing you in this short time period of a class, you're developing the skill and seeing that people are going different places, then they would have if you had just used your regular listening that you came in with today. So great. Yeah. So I am accustomed to asking lots of questions. And so I was like, you're so trained in asking questions and getting to the wide. So at the beginning, sometimes I wanted to ask the question, like a follow-up question. But I watched how I actually was talking and I was not thinking. Like she herself was figuring out how she actually felt, what she was speaking. Versa, if I had an interjecting with a question, which maybe could have guided the conversation, but right then I would have been kind of leading it maybe to what I wanted. But she got to figure out how she felt about it. And then as we progressed and there's still a lot more about why certain things in her. And then they just expressed it. Like they feel like eating something. They're trying to come to that. Oh, this maybe feels as if they don't want. And I would have not. I don't know if I'd have been interested. Yeah, exactly. So going back to something as we said earlier, like people are processing in the moment. And they're figuring it out as they're saying. And also recognizing that your questions can direct and kind of move into the direction of 50. Yeah, I think the one looks at it. You kind of have to be open enough to be okay to not learn from it what you find interesting about what they're saying. Like all of what you're saying is just perfect. I'm just saying things. Like I just found myself in like, oh, I want to do, like that's an interesting thing to me. Like I want to do it to that more. And typically I probably would be like, oh, like, you know, whatever. And you have to be okay with just like not, it's not about you. So it's like, you know, it's not about it. And like maybe what they get out of it is different than what you find interesting. Not the case. But like just say, you know, it's, yeah. I'm like, this is how it's like. Cute is like, of like what you find interesting. They not be what they think. Yeah, that's a great point. Is it beginning? I feel like it's so hard for me to not ask questions because it's so hard to make it not about myself. But deeper and then get more customized to that. I realize, say, one item having a composition with people. And I should just realize, I mean, you have a capacity. Do I understand what the question is talking about? Half a capacity is the 50% of my brain capacity processing, but I want to say. And not allowing the hundred capacity to focus on the other party. And like, oh, actually, I understand that personally better, a little more than what I would have done, you know, the other way. Yeah, great insight of like our limited capacity to do both at the same time. And you're automatically choosing one over the other of your age conversations. It also, I've never been to therapy in the game. I'm just going to say what you feel. But at one point, like I said, something. And then I don't really know why. I do like the question I create after. He was like, why did you say that? And then I like to keep her. And I was able to do like, you know, the problem with the air. Dr. Porti, you take the quiz. That's the right answer. I guess the point is, like, the question I do, he asked me was more like, help me understand myself. And I'm like, I can't do it with weird things, but you don't know. Right, right, point. And I want to build on this a little bit more. We talked about what it's like to be the listener. What was it like as a speaker? So there's this, this is going to sound super smart, quite honest. There's this French guy named Marie Smolow-Ponti. He's a philosopher. He has this quote where he says, he should accomplish his thought. And I think that's what it should be. As I, like, the first minute of the question, I felt like a little bit superficial in my answers. But then as I spoke for longer and longer, I realized that speaking helped me actually to say what I wanted to say and what I actually thought. And I felt like the conversation, even though it wasn't really a conversation for the last section, it felt more authentic as it went longer and longer. Yeah, a lot of you did the deeper as you think you were about it. Yeah, I think I first would part this. And if you said it, I apologize, this last month, a little bit of blended together. But building off of that is like, I remember a quote where someone said, you don't know what you think until you say it. You kind of have to try it on. Right? It's like, hey, I kept this belief and you speak it. And then it's like, oh, that didn't fit. Or that fits like glove and you kind of keep going off of that. So I think when you're forced to keep talking, if someone were to jump in, then you don't, you can say, oh, I didn't have to try it on. It's kind of that safety net of like, I didn't really need to go there. But when you just have to fill up five minutes, it's like, hey, I went there and either you did or didn't like it. Yeah, really great. Instead of like trying to get out and seeing how they bet. Well, what it was exactly like that. And they did for the new years. And what was time to try and we did all the work together in this class. But maybe you talk to them some things that I felt about it, and things I'm going through. I think in the name of my, in his, the terms that I haven't heard right now. And that's you, I'm talking to you now, and he's expressing my feelings. And obviously I have to meet the students. So I would reach talk about that matter that I address that thing that I have, like, is me, the biggest part of the person. And it was able to not just work, but it was just like 30 minutes ago. Yeah, which is a great root point too, right? Like often we think about trust being things we have to do, things we have to show, but trust can build just in holding that space, right? And showing that you care by just listening to anyone. Yeah, the same. At the beginning, I thought very awkward to have all this air tight. Yeah, I appreciate your time. Especially when you keep seeing anything like that. This guy, and that kind of person that has to think about what I'm going to respond to. It feels rude, not to respond. I don't know where I got that. But it's like that for me. But then I'm listening to Carlos, and listening to him to help open up a bit. And then I also found myself opening up a bit about what I say one sentence in that is very superficial. But then he's not saying anything, so he kept me going. So I guess it's very effective in setting out your real emotions. So we get along in that space. It's powerful. This is not exactly what we were saying. You put the two people that don't really like to yet together. So we found that we had a lot of extra time. Because we've done talking. Don't really have anything else to say. And I don't want to fill the time. And that's kind of what both of us ended up doing. But something we both noticed is we'd look around. And it'd be like the listener would be looking directly, trying to make eye contact with the person. And the speaker would, because they're actively trying to figure out what they're wanting to say, and they're working through that. They'd be looking anywhere but the listener. And I think part of it is just like if you're looking at them, maybe you're distracted by them. But it was interesting because people are actively trying to figure out what they are thinking, what their thoughts are, and translating that into speech. So that was kind of interesting to observe. Great observation of the rose pairing. I know. I think we think. Well, one thing about me is I can talk for seven minutes. So that wasn't a hard thing. But it was interesting to have the prompts, I think, because I could talk about love island for seven minutes and no problem. But having to talk about M.B. vulnerable with someone, and like, lately, when I was saying it's funny, because we're always partners, just because we're in this same group. And so I feel like we've been by each other and with each other for the last half of many weeks. We've been here, but I felt really awesome to be able to dive deeper like, it's anything about that trust of like, that maybe we're going to get farther into this semester and need that. And it's going to, and I just think it was awesome to have the prompts to be able to open up and hear what other person has to say about specific, vulnerable topics. It does take a little bit of a prompting in order to get there and to create that sort of thing. This is how I'm going to look at your federal question. Like, for the three-night question, seven-night question, I didn't have to think about it for the first time. Like, the second-way question, I probably talked to a whole time very little in front, because there's just another problem. On the public side, two things that I had never thought about before, there was a lot of things. So having to just, I guess, before to think out loud and basically, I think either side of the silence or just being out loud, I always think of the question, I think I was going to say that. OK, so being more or less prepared to answer questions to make a difference in the question. Yeah, I mean, for the talking subjects, I feel like I'm a talker. And a lot of the times I talk, because there's a scarcity mindset, where it's like, if I do too much listening, then I'm not going to be able to give the input that I want to give. But I was the second speaker, and I noticed that, like, I didn't even see things at the beginning. Like, the first question, I thought a lot about how I would answer that question, and then you changed the question. And I was like, OK, I just missed a lot of things. But then, like, the second time around, I just listened. And then, like, you gave me the question, and I was like, me and you actually a lot more or less or more than I thought we were. And it's like backwards to what you would logically think and then, no matter what. As I listened better than him, I felt the need to talk less, because we're more similar than I thought. And I could just be like, yeah, I actually just agree with you. So we're pretty much the same. That's what I'm saying. Beautiful. Great answer. Great answer. Yeah, but first, to the question. You were struggling. I was struggling. Yes. I was very talking to you. Yeah. I was just like, you never really know what that was. This is what has the need to speak and respond. Eight to seven minutes, go by your social class. So just like, I don't know if people ever just mess up their not speak when I talk to them. And then, given us that's probably not the case, it's I would run out of case to say, but just even like, just knowing that you can respond, maybe it's so much easier. And you can't even respond a whole time. Which is funny. Yeah. It was only interesting watching you guys with the seven minutes, because like I said before, it was very different than if we had started that way. Much more listening and like those non-verbal responses, but letting them person just speak. All right. I saw a hand over here, Evan, and then there, and Jared, and then me. Well, I guess what's that I was saying, like people looking around, that's me, because I, the question I really didn't think about that question before, so like I wasn't really in no one to say, but you know, because obviously, it would be me having to have the same team for a while. I feel like I feel comfortable just randomly saying random stuff and you will listen. I think, I just toss up very important, right? I think you mentioned earlier about how like John's satisfaction versus like, you know, they was the other one listening. Yeah, I think that's really important. Because I think about how much time you have worked. This thing about like also a part of marriage as well, like you feel like marriage is all talked about. You and this thing will come to you, okay? I think, something was work, right? If you want to stay in company long term, you want to make sure everybody is your family in the way, right? So I think you had to shave, I think you had to shave your coworker as a family. If you want to be there, feel comfortable, and be there long term, so. Okay, so showing the impact for sure. Yeah, the main thing I learned my main takeaway today is like, acting listening is a skill that you can actually develop. And I think my wife will be thrilled. You're welcome. Yeah, and that's the point. Like take this today and use it. Practice it, develop it, take it home, see what happens. Very sweet. I was just saying like for, I think both of us, we both had like, you know, facing down this like the majority of the issue or all feeling the failure of this happens. And then, but because the person was acting listening, we had the time to like sit there, he had to work through it in our mind, and be like, well, now how can I resolve that? How can I prevent that from happening? And like, you know, I'm sure that if we ask for the other person's opinion, well, I try to have tons of opinions on how to help you with that problem. But I think that, yeah, probably the best solutions are going to come. At least for emotional things, or feeling, feeling a failure, whatever, the best solutions to those kinds of questions are always going to come from the side. And so having the space to work that through, especially with another person that you can count to, I think the main thing is. Amazing insight, and a great one to end up. Recognizing that people have their own solutions, they just might need the space to fight. And you can do that through advocacy. So how do you use this at work? Again, getting people to space, modeling silences really important, so modeling this for people because you found that it was fairly easy to reciprocate with someone that had listened to you. And then, if you need a reminder, remember this accurate weight, why am I talking before you jump in to sleep? And then, you can advise, ask more questions. Tell me more before you do that. And then, one of the most important things, especially to uncover those emotions, and the things that people aren't saying, is listening with the spirit. So really trying to pull in that Christ-like listening and recognize that there may be things that they're not saying that you can kind of un-earth and breathe with this disorder. So bring that into listening as well. All right, on Wednesday, we have a reading and a case. So the reading is about fair processes. I think about it in regards to the Ricardo Summer case, so we will be talking about fairness there. And then today, remember to small, small one sentence, a most assignment on the canvas, telling me what leadership skills you work on or what leadership style. And then, your essay is due on Wednesday. Go. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you."
