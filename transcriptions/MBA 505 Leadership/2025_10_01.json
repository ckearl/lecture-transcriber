  "text": "but well, it's called the last few years ago. So, two years ago. First time I taught the leadership class, and I was thinking of that. So I had to have her back and we'll put on over a moment. So, thank you. Applause. Hi guys, I'm Nathalie Hubbard. I graduated from the program. I'm now at one heart. What we'll do is throw through introduce ourselves. And I want to give you a few back to those three letters to make. I'm the oldest research officer in the years, and I give some anecdotes that really relate to leadership class. You're thinking of these kind of buildings, so I'll show how water quotes are associates, accountable for customers, and also really wonderful stories on the pitch. So, this is me, and from El Paso, Texas, I've been very, very, very busy, and I've been working here to kiss Laird, who's four, and who is two. We've loved outside. In fact, I just found out that last night, in my position, I bought my daughter like a mini motorcycle. I'm not going to say that. That's a lot. I love, I said this last night, and I'll continue to say it. I love those three, and I love being a part of it. And so, this is a real treat to you here. I did my undergraduate view on the over-husturalism, and then I came back to view my end of the day after working in sugarcane for a few years. Did my internship at Walburn as well in women's production? And now I am in grocery, and a cyber-team-side grocery grocery. Some of the breakfast, baking, and coffee markets. Here are some pictures. That's my time of my internship with another people on the A. Yeah, there's my pick. Okay. APPLAUSE It's good to be reading. And Jen Sparks. I've been with Walmart almost 30 years, and just in a while, so I've felt like I've been 30 years in Walmart. I did not attend the NYU. I don't have an MBA at all, but I'd like to think that I have a master's degree in Walmart. I came here so long. I have one daughter, Abby. She is a senior in nursing school, at Cardin University, at Christian University in Arkansas. So that's a big empty nester. Herds, she's my only daughter. I will miss her terribly. But we love the travel, and my career journey, I started in Walmart actually in IT. So I spent about a decade working in the mainframe operations, mainframe old school. That's a whole lot of life. And then I long career in merchandising. And so I worked in several groups across the years, exploring goods, I had live numbers, exciting fishing tackle, crafts and reels. And then I took a couple of seasons with seasonal celebrations, of how we manage our interests, Eastern, have firm supplies, and the oddies, breeding cars, things like that. I worked with Scott, who will introduce himself in a little bit, in our stationery school and office, workshops area. And I currently have frozen foods. So ice cream, pizza, frozen vegetables, something like that. I'm also a huge Walmart in Harvard. I love working with Walmart. I just feel like Walmart's culture is ingrained in every piece of me. And I hope that that is conveyed today, they're on our stories. But if somebody here with you today, we've recruited such great talent for me by you. And so I'm really excited to speak with you today. And I'm going to give you a hand. Here with you. Okay, and I'm Scott Davis. You'll hear us use some words like merchant and stuff. And to me that always made me feel like are there camels involved in this? You know, we're going across the desert. But merchants kind of interchangeable with buyers. If you hear a buyer, or if you're familiar with marketing and you hear brand manager, there are roles we have like a brand manager of retail. So instead of managing toothpaste, or coldgate or something, it's like you're managing all toothpaste forever and you're in key to customer trends and all that stuff. So the roles that we have on the team, that we play are like kind of the ecosystem of brand manager of a company over the social and financial context. I'm a BYU alumnated, I've been read in Chinese with almost a business minor. So, and then I did that planning to do, getting MBA and work on international business. So, between a random grad school I'm not a gateway at University of New York. We were looking overseas, we were to build new theme parks. Actually a former classmate now is CEO of University of Beijing. So, also a BYU alumnated. So, kind of fun there. Let's see. University also then after business school, I worked at Honeywell and then realized I needed something more fast pace than aerospace. So I got into computers. A gateway computer is then Polaroid. Moog overseas lived in China for a while. And that's where I joined Walmart. Actually, in their China office doing sourcing stuff. So, doing sourcing, it has a fun doing. You know, I was involved in the early launch period of my life fast, which is like, you know, how American girl calls. Like, that's the $100 sort of rich kid version. We want to make that accessible for more people and give it some also some skin tone that people can relate to. And then a lot of the on-brand, which is in our computer area, to an office applied to the Jennifer. That was really awesome. And then currently I look after our automotive business. So, when you go on the store, you see the stuff on the shelf or on the site, or you get your car service to Walmart. That's what I work on. All right. Applause. And I'm David Chamberlain. I'm also BYU MBA alumni class of 23. This is actually my first time in a leadership class. Because right before my first semester, the then professor had to take a sabbatical and Art Cobord actually didn't get this course. So, everything I know about corporate leadership, I learned at Walmart. So, we'll share from that perspective. But it's great to be with you all. You know, I grew up in Michigan, did my undergrad at BYU in mechanical engineering. After that, worked for the church for a grad. I worked for the MTC for several years, you know, part-time full-time. And then I taught at least time seminary in the Gilbert Arizona area for three years. I realized I loved building people, but I also wanted some of that analytical aspects of coming back to BYU and got my MBA. And I've been with Walmart for several years. My wife and I are just kind of in the thick of it with raising our four kids right now. We've got, you know, there are three different schools in between young women's and the activity days, and kids' sports, and all sorts of things. They keep us pretty busy. But we love to, you know, get out and travel when we can and enjoy spending a lot of time with our family. In Northwest Arkansas, I love playing at the ball. And of course, the mountain bike seat there is incredible. So, we want to talk today a little bit about how Walmart how we can internalize the leadership principles that you're learning and what those look like at Walmart. And hopefully give you an example that you can carry forward into your careers wherever you end up. We've looked for many of you to come join us at Outlaw Mark. But understand that the reality is a lot of you are going to go different places and do wonderful different things. So hopefully these principles can be applicable to you throughout your careers. Outlaw Mark, we're a people-led tech-powered army channel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. That people-led, I think, is especially relevant today. There's a lot of news and buzz about AI, and how AI is shaping the industry a lot of different ways. Some people are wondering, you know, does that mean that a lot of these big companies are going to have layouts? But certainly not the case of Walmart. There's the tech is going to enable us to be more efficient. But that means that our people can lean into what they're best at. And that's been the messaging across the board. And that means that Walmart continues to invest in its people. When we talk about leadership and we talk about, you know, success as an organization, Walmart, that really starts with people. So if we come to, if you look at these four values, they should look familiar because I think they're just going to like post it around the tent or building, right? These are the Marriott School of Core Values. You know, leadership should always be mission driven, right? There's always a reason for you to, you know, I love the same people don't buy what you're doing, but they buy why you're doing it. And so if you're a purpose driven, if you're anchored in your core values, the Marriott School values being faith and Christ excellence, respect for all and integrity and action. A lot of people ask me since we've had like 20 BYU MBAs join the Walmart merchandising over the past five years, how Walmart, like internally, people not associated with BYU, they ask me, hey, you know, I know you hope it's recruiting. How are you able to have so much success recruiting at BYU and Walmart? And that's because this alignment right here between the core values. You see that these values are one and the same. Your place faith and Christ was serviced to the customer, and those two things aren't all that different. And you have excellence, respect for the individual, and act with integrity. And these values permeate the organization, and it's not something that we just do lip service. In order to really succeed as an organization, you need to have people that are bought in, that believe in the organization's mission, and that needs to be at every level of leadership. So it starts at the very top. Our CEO of Dogg McMillan is constantly sharing updates and sharing messages surrounding these values and driving our mission forward for the customer. This is just a quote that came up from last week to show the recency and the consistency of this messaging across all levels of the organization. And ultimately, the takeaway is that it's not so much what we're doing or what are going about doing, but why we're doing it. And for Walmart, that means offering the best possible values that we can to the customer and doing it in the right way. And that's the messaging that's consistent across the board. So what does this actually look like? It's great to have core values that you believe in, but when the rubber meets the road, right? It isn't business. So how do we actually put those values into practice? There are several different ways in which we do that. Our topic for today is accountability. So we're going to share our perspective on this lens through that lens of accountability. The first place in which we're accountable to, that we want to discuss it, is we have to get accountable to the business. If you're not, if your business isn't performing well, then no matter how much good your organization has, wants to do or whatever goals you want to pursue, if you're not in business tomorrow, then you can't do that good in the world. And so when we're accountable to the business, this is something that kind of permeates throughout the organization within merchandising. We have a shared responsibility for our P&L. You have the merchant teams. You have your replenishment managers. You have your financial planning teams, business analytics. You have your shortman teams. All those teams live within merchandising. And are responsible for what we call our five-for-five metrics. And so that's our sales, our gross profit percentage, gross profit dollars, you know, our inventory dollars and our digital sales percentage. And it's something that is talked about weekly, regularly, you know, and so when we're discussing this, something like, how do we hold associates accountable? It's like, well, we don't really need to. Everyone just feels that accountability for their business, because it's such a natural part of our reporting, and such a natural part of what we talk about. And it's a shared accountability. I mentioned this last night that when there's a miss, or when something goes wrong, there's never a finger pointing, but there's always, okay, what do we learn from that? And how do we then correct this so that moving forward, we can avoid that type of mistake again? And it's about the people coaching them up. One thing that's interesting is, within some organizations, you can see some silos, right? And this is something that I want you to watch more, you know, as you go out in the business world, there is something that you experienced, where people can get territorial over their part of the business, right? You know, if Jen is working in frozen foods, maybe she's saying, okay, I'm going to do what's best for the frozen food department, regardless of whether that's best, you know, for the fresh food department next to us. And the way that we combat that is by having a shared accountability for our business and our performance and bonus structures being aligned to a total company. And so, yes, each business is accountable for, like, their five-for-five metrics within their own sphere. But everyone is pulling together for the success, because both our stock performance and equity, we have good incentive alignment to drive the success of the total business. Anything you'd add to that? Right now. So, for that's accountability to the business, Jen's going to share with us something even more accountable, and important than being accountable to the business, but that's to our customers. You see, now, things that's really right, you know, we have to be accountable to the P&L, we've got share on the alerts, it's an important part of what we do. But first and foremost, we are accountable to the mission of our company, which is to start our customers. And so, we have a mission at Walmart to save people money so they can live better. The living better looks different to everyone. You know, living better to me would be, I would love to save money on my groceries and things, to maybe invest in a hobby, particular vacation, but living better to some of our customers is far less exciting than that. So, we have a long-time merchant in our gathering department come to all merchandising meetings a few years ago, and for the story and share the challenge to all of us. And it's really spectacular with some of us that were there for that story. So, this picture is a really typical Walmart experience. You know, if you go to anyone where it's the word, you might see a basket full of kids, barely dressed, like I got all their groceries and necessities laid out on that line. Super-typical. This is our everyday customer. However, what you can't see in this picture is this picture is taken at midnight on the first day of the month. And that is because snap benefits of government-funded grocery assistance loads on your EVT card at midnight on the first of the month. Living better for this mom, right, this busy mom would be not getting her kids out of bed at 11 o'clock, right? And not having her to the store, and waiting for midnight to happen to be able to feed her family breakfast the next morning. So, when you look at that picture, it seems so typical, but seeing that from the perspective of, wow, that's our customer. And how do we help that customer be able to sleep through the night and live better by having breakfast the next morning? So, probably our long-time daily merchant took it upon himself to, if he can just end the dairy department, save her 3% on the cost of goods on her necessities in the dairy, he could buy that family one more meal, and the leavens leaked through the night. And so, that's what he did. He wasn't given a 3% target. He had a different financial numbers company data, but he wanted tracing in her family west Virginia where that was taken to be able to sleep there. And so, he mixed out his department, investing in cheese and some other things to help lower the price of milk and eggs to be able to provide that. And so, he threw down the car and looked that day, right? We are all in the room. Every one of us needs to do that, because at the end of the day, we're accountable to our customers. And those customers look different all across the country. And so, the challenge was accepted. And that's the mission that we're after, trying to save people money, because they can look back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Does anybody work at Walmart before? If you know, if someone were out and asked you, who's Walmart is it, you know what you'd say? It's my Walmart. It's my Walmart, right? Yeah, nice job. You've asked at that. Right? This is neverbody who works at Walmart knows this, right? Who's Walmart? It's my Walmart. So, this is a principle of our culture. Walmart is the first place where the culture has really been aggressively lived. You saw those four things. Pretty much everybody in work will say something like that. This is the first place that actually lives at it, and what is it aggressively? And so, as we were reflecting on this topic of accountability, leadership in our culture, how do you have accountability to it? And Barb, it's more empowered and asked to do good things. Ask to help people live better, right? And so, like here's an example that I had an opportunity to be part of. And that is, you know, I grew up in Tika, Kansas, right? So, when you hear Brown versus Board of Education, the Civil Rights case, that was the Board of Education that I was in, right? And so, my school was very integrated. It had race riots in the 60s and 70s, that kind of thing. But when I was there, you know, it was very integrated, very, like we were team, and if you went there, we all kind of had this sense of that there's something that needs to be done. It's us that needs to do it. You know, I feel like that's part of the culture of the heritage of being Brown versus Board of Education. So, in your career, I think you'll find some opportunities like I found here. We were working on back to school. And if you notice back to school, like Walmart prices are 50 cents for crowns. By the way, they cost us about twice that. And everybody matches this. So, for regular crowns, like there's no real reason for the customer to choose Walmart over anybody else. So, our buyer and Krell, they ran a room there for extra money. How do we win this next season, right? He, by the way, he's a choice designer of EYU alum. So, and so they brought us to the chemical, all these ideas. We can have like thermal chromatic or photochromatic, low on the dark, right? So, whatever they have, all these ideas, and you'll see some ideas like that if you go to the aisle. And then they had an idea of what about skin tones that actually reflect, like look how diverse the skin tones even are in this. Like we're not the most, we're relatively homogenous, I would think, as a classroom in the US. And yet, look how many different colors are in their reds. They're all kinds of colors, right? And this was an idea. So, they came back to like, hey, here's what we're thinking. And got all these ideas with like 10 of them on the list. And as soon as I heard this one, I knew it was my chance to have a chance. And I knew it was my chance to make a difference. And to give a voice to people who are underrepresented in the law. So, I said, no need to pursue the other ones. This is the one we want to do. And so, we worked with cosmetic industry professionals and all kinds of marketing insights and stuff like that. And we launched colors of the world. So, I'll pass these around, go on and pass them around there. But this is a great example of where we felt our mission is to serve the customer and to save people money so they can live better. And so, they can live better in respect for the individual you saw those principles. How do we hold ourselves accountable when we see the opportunity? And business-wise, it was a great decision. We did draw traffic, it was exclusive to Walmart. We launched additional lines and every line and colors of the world was exclusive to Walmart before it became available to others. We've got great sales points. We've created a lot of media too. But the reason we did it was our commitment to the customer. Okay, here's another interesting example. And this one, also accountability, this applies to how you work with suppliers. So, customers first, what do customers expect you to deliver? But then also, how do you work with suppliers in business-chargers in the accountable way? And the same principles that you hear here will apply to how you work with people. So, we've heard, kind of, recrue the times with sharpness, right? And then you have a warm relationship. And so, here's an example. In school and office supplies again, all of our contracts with suppliers had language in them that said, all of your wood source products that needs to be sustainable source. But I saw an opportunity to level up that standard. And so, we actually made it a product quality, part of our product quality definition, because we knew our customers expected that to be great stewards over the environment. And so, basically, what this means is, instead of a thing in a contract, it's specific that they sign, but it's not easy to enforce and not really specifically enforced. It becomes like, before we winery receive a delivery, if there's not paperwork certified from a third-party that is sustainable, but we reject the shipping. Like, it is not acceptable to us. And that inventory is now there's the worry about, not ours to worry about. So, it's a risk, because I need to sell stuff, right? But I knew we wanted to do this. And so, the way we implemented it, though, is a good example of this accountability principle. So, we wanted to level up our standards and the industry standards. And being at Walmart is not enough zeros behind the numbers, you know, that you can do that. And, but it took about two years for it to go from, you know, the signature in the contract versus the inability to third-party certified. And so, it was a teaching moment, really. We didn't, if they didn't certify immediately, then we worked with them. We helped them. We worked with the industry like FSC and these guys up here. We worked with them to get efficient supply chains. What we found was actually for paper, it was pretty quick and pretty easy. It cost us like a percent more. With wood, though, so like pencils, like it was 10, 15 percent more. There was not an efficient supply chain when we started. But two years in, the prices have come down and now, because of the volume we put in, we're able to bring that whole supply chain along. Now, if you go to any of our competitors, all of their wood or paper-based products are also certified. So, it's a kind of a cool opportunity. So, for me, this goes back to, it's my Walmart, right? You have ownership and accountability to do things that you can do. You need to look for those opportunities to do as good in the world. And then this is like this approach of teaching rather than firing the supplier, you talk, right? And you help them along, you do the training, you work with industry partners, help them. Proves it along. All right. ABCs? I think. Right, definitely, now that our CEO is always meeting with us on principles of our company integrity. Recently, he met with us on not letting things stand in our way. Walmart is Fortune One. It's been Fortune One for a long time, and it would be so easy to be like, we've been Fortune One for a long time, clearly what's working for us is going to continue to work for us. However, technology is changing quickly. Our customers are changing rapidly. What they want to buy is changing how they want it, how they want to shop, how quickly they want it. And so his message to us recently to say hello to those customers is to not let the ABCs get in our way. So, arrogance is the first thing you can do for your breath, right? Going back to Fortune One, we can be very arrogant about, we're already the top company, the wow. Competition is on our deals. Competition is beating us in some places in the country for sure. We cannot get the money, we can't stay with a arrogant mindset. We have to be able to change quickly and adapt to our customers needs. Your accuracy, this is a killer in a big company. Our company decides, and this much money is made, the bureaucracy sometimes is tough, right? And we cannot let bureaucracy stay in our way as a message to us. Technology takes a long time, the approval process takes a long time. It's even get capital expenditures for a new test when the store takes a long time and requires a lot of approval. It doesn't want back to stay in our way. You want to have a voice and speak up and not let our long approval process or our long testing times and things stay in our way and move it forward. A complacency. Along with arrogance, you know, we can't get complacent about what worked for us for the last 20 years. It's not going to work for us as a company in the coming years. Everything is changing too quickly. So this message says, don't be complacent. That's exactly why we're trying to hire top terrorists, right? The Walden family has invested a ton of money into the building of the area to get more attracted to attract people like you. Right? We need people to come in with fresh perspectives, innovative ideas. We can't be complacent. I've been a 30-year person in my whole life at Walmer. I grew up in North West Ruffinsville. That might make me stack it. All I know is Walmer. I have to continue to be able to change and learn and learn from people like you. Right? You've been in different industries. You've been in different areas in the country. You've seen different stores than I've seen in my hometown. And so the complacency is a big piece of North America's driving ahead. It was the 8th portion one. And we need innovative thought to be that. And so I love that the continues to challenge us on don't let the AECs. All right. All right. I'm not going to take those crowns and stuff off. So I think it would be like, hey, I got kids who love these. Can you play them? All right. So respect for the individual. This is a really interesting one. I think there are a few principles I'd like to talk about here. But you'll probably work in the companies where there are a lot of politics. Where there are people that swear, cuss you out, you know, things like that. I've been in places like that. And then I mentioned like Walmart really the first place that it is. Like all those companies said respect for the individual. All of them said, have integrity. And so I think this is good for you to reflect no matter what company you end up at. Or here in this program, what are you adding to the culture of the program for companies? How do you live or help the company live its culture and live the principle of its deposits? When I joined Walmart, I was in China. And I thought, oh, okay, because I've had from the outside, you know, most of your associations which you shop with, you know, your shopping experience, which you read in the news. And some of the stuff you see in the news is great. Other stuff you see in the news is like if somebody has an accident right, if they grind it against Walmart or an Amazon, it's way more pressworthy than if they talk about it with somebody else. So I was a little bit like, I'm probably going to, my job is probably going to be all about beating up suppliers and saying, give me lower costs, you know. And when I joined, like, that wasn't anywhere on my objective objectives. And my objectives were, you know, drive increases in improvements in quality performance. Build out our sustainability, the time we're building out our sustainability, accountability, things like that. So it was very, quite a bit different from what I saw. And another principle, Walmart has its respect for the individual. And I talked about like, dispensing and stuff like that, right? But it's beyond like, our view of respect for the individual is not just when I work with Mattel-Einer-Genn that we have like a positive relationship and we're engaging for a win, you know, with positive intent. It's not just about that. It's about, who are my suppliers, do I respect that? Who are the, who are the employees of those suppliers? And I've been in the environment. I have a goal to respect that. And so when I joined the company, we were implementing this factory, this factory onboarding an accountability process. So you think like Walmart does some big numbers. So first we have to worry about, what do they have capacity and like the quality capabilities that we need? One of my jobs was in electronics and literally I went into a factory that had been a shoe factory like four years before and now they were building, you know, at the time it was a DVD recorders and stuff. I'm like, probably not the best choice here, you know? So anyway, we were able to change someone out. So we do that kind of thing. Like, can they produce our stuff like me and their other honest, we do like, you know, there's some people who are asking, you know, I'm like, in board regulations and stuff. But we also have this, what we're calling here, you know, that it's my Walmart stuff, which means like, we own this, this is something we're proud to do, this is our mission. And it's a social and compliant type. Do they have other age workers? And the factory, do they have people who are not there by choice? Are they using prison labor? So we actually go out of those. And it's not Walmart people, often auditors, we have checkers of the auditors, but it used to be, it used to be on Walmart people, but what we found actually is it's too easy to bribe people if it's a consistent person. Alex could show up and we'd say, hey, Alex, here's 500 bucks. Thanks for coming so much. Because Alex, if he fails a product shipment, it's going to be some of the ton of money. So Alex has an undue power, right? So we had three, we found three different external third parties who come in, a lot of the factors for these things. And they would rotate around. So it would never be the same one that would be showing up. And then we would double check them with our own people. So this is another way, like you'd think about China or India, or Vietnam, some of these places should read a Cambodia. They're all good examples. Their legal system says all the things you would want it to say pretty much for environmental protection. It just as an example. Or for underage workers. They all say the right stuff. But their enforcement is often the last and weak. And so because of the size of the pen we have and the zeros behind the numbers, we can actually have a larger impact on compliance with those laws than the governments in those countries. So this was kind of for us. This was also an example of learning. Like if we find a factory and they are doing underage employment, like a red thing, and we cancel all orders with them, right? But our real goal is what we'll often find is, hey, the fire evacuation, there's some stuff in the way there. You got two months to fix these things. Here's how you do it. So it's really about teaching. Kind of like we talked about with the sustainability piece. It's about teaching a better way, teaching highway, providing than that information. So it goes back to that, that, hey, you have an accountability discussion. Hey, let's talk about how to get from here to there, and then working with that team group. So, I think that's that. That's it. It's Q and A time. I think we've got some time for Q and A. So just, we clap a lot. I'm so like, that's fun. All right. But, yeah, any questions for the group on the top of two scene? Space, since you were clapping. Yeah. I had a question about the difference. A lot of you had to have a different experience within Walmart in the different, maybe see verticals or departments. How cross collaborative are you with a different verticals? Like, I can see maybe like, seasonal widths, school supplies, right? Like, do you guys work cross collaboratively? Obviously, you can move a lot, but kind of what's that experience like? So, I mean, for me, I think that's a great point. I think we've run ourselves working with other departments that have similar, even, and where we're all a supply chain perspective. So for instance, if I'm working in a highly directed, important business, I will often collaborate with my other directed, important businesses. If you think that home does a lot of directed work, I have a lot of that in seasonal. So, do you have best practices? What are you doing in this situation? If you build a new tool, and you did talk to all the people that do their homework, and you can collaborate? So there's a lot of that. Let's see. And then just our past experiences, you know, for us, it is very common to move around with different departments. Highly encouraged to do that on what have I learned here? What can I have done in another department? What kind of leadership do they need over here? What's the people over here? And so, to keep in contact with the people that you know, who's the great storm right now? It's a great question, though, because as a big, such a big company, you have to fight bureaucracy and silos. And so there are a lot of good examples where we cross-polline. You know, David had this slide here. So this is our annual review, and your performance rating, did you meet your goal tonight? It's really based on this. But your bonus is based on Walmart, US, or performance. So you have, like, hey, get what, get done. What we asked you to get done is this version. And then your bonus is based on, did you work well across teams? Did you enable other teams, or did you get a political fight and say, no? It's better for my business if we don't do that, even though it might be better for the customer to do something else. So as a leader, getting Kathy, how do you minimize that? First off, thank you for explaining merchandising. It's because I'm coming from the tech world, and I'm like, I kind of misunderstood what it was, but now I'm intrigued. So with the merchandising, it sounds like you own a product category, and you want the whole category to grow like toothpaste or school supplies. But then you talk about the Crayola example, where you're working with Crayola to create kind of a product that's unique to you. So is that like normal in this type of role? Like you work with your suppliers, and you can do like product innovation as well? 100% and we do it all the time. So it's really fun and well. We do even have product developers as part of the ecosystem. So like the NBA rotation program we have, we have rotations through product development, for people that are interested in that. But yeah, we work, we collaborate with suppliers all the time, we come up design, where they leave white space, we actually use our private brand team to fill in the white space. So we'll actually design our own products and source them to fill in the white space. You're like sales. But, yeah, because I don't care what it says, but it's like you're growing your categories, you're completing sales in the category. Yeah, yeah. Like an interesting example of buyer driven innovation, working with suppliers is in our car care category. So if you're, well this is, that's going to be second years in the Vans Red. Hey, we'll talk about that there. But a lot of the, there's a lot, it's not really a private brand category, but it's a, it's kind of an old and new brand category. We have Armour All and New Finish, Terrol Wax, but Buyers, these are all the old school, you know, like historically amazing places. And they're, they're working hard to try to figure out how to be visual and connect with younger generation. They're not doing so well. But the buyer has worked with more premium, new emerging brands like chemical guys and Ados. Who really started as a detailer of brands, and then they went direct to consumer. And now they're, now they're in Walmart, great quality items. They're more expensive, but it did, it's the customer up front of the choice that they want. So it's pretty interesting. So the buyer has driven that and you're able to create businesses when you find them. So it's, you're looking at customer trends, where does keep trends and how do you capitalize on them? Yeah. Alex. I would not have to, I have $3. I do a little question, very interesting, like I can see. So the complacency point, right? And obviously, one of that Walmart's recently been Walmart plus, kind of, you know, Amazon, right? Or other online places. What are some, uh, upcoming, like, changes or, or things that Walmart's trying to get ahead of, to kind of fight back in places to, to that normal spot? Yeah. I mean, yeah. What are some of the ideas of digital experience, right? Our customers want things balanced and they want it anyway they can. And you think of our store presence, the $47,000 source of plastic that could be, how can we leverage those assets to provide a digital figure? So we're looking at, we have areas right now, when we know that we're starting to do drumming, delivery, like, we're trying all kinds of things, like parachutes coming in waiting in the evening. So we're trying to get ahead of where our customers are now, and then what, what they want in the future. So how do we leverage, um, our own assets, and so for instance, what we're talking about, and you, you know, experience we're having on it, a start shop. So we have a store that is not open to the public, right? That we're sending, we're stopping it like a store that our delivery drivers are going there to pick up the delivery orders, right? How do we get along this blue OPD card, just taking the delivery cards out of our customers' way? How do we leverage putting that product somewhere else to make it quicker? So we've been able 30-minute delivery, you know, express delivery at no time. So really thinking, you know, how could we get our customer to their product? How, what products they want? So enabling marketplace for every item? So it's trying to help you, whatever you want to buy, and hopefully buy a normal product home. So I think digital, in particular, is really leaning in, and your growth targets are focused around digital. You want to grow our buying source customers of course, that's not where our customers are growing. And so how do we make it easier for our papers? How do we make it easier for the delivery drivers as the electrician? Is merchandising involved in those strategic roles? Or is that just... Certainly. I'll take my own department as an example. 27% of our sales and sales are digital generated, which is crazy. 27% of all our purchases are starting with your phone. And so that means in store, from a picker perspective, we have to design our modular system. Right? Do you have to streamline a sort of rebound possibly? Because I might eat five facings of something that sells that differently, because digital is growing so fast that we want the pickers to be able to find it, because our spot shoppers can't win our back. So we hear the strategy the company is wearing, which is merchandising, we're enabling to make sure that that strategy is successful. I'd say we suffer for a good place and see about a decade ago. We stall now our stock price up around 50 bucks for a long time, and then we live on fire. The company is all about change, and it's part why we have an MBA recruiting program. We're looking for people who can fly through our city, over a change, or all about change. That's a big question. All right, I don't know who George is. Yeah, so a CEO of James, like AI is this buzzword, right? And so, seeing a tech power company, like what's one we're dealing with AI? Because I don't know. So I can come from like that company, and we're looking for people who are interested in what you have to do. Well, hey, it's the first now. All right, we yesterday in Automotive, we launched an AI, the first AI experience that's kind of where, in our app, you'll see what we call Sparky. So if you're shopping, you might see some AI cues, like questions you might have about a product line. So now if you're shopping with type for tires, that Sparky AI is actually engaging with an Automotive AI that has specific connections. So it's focused on all tires right now, but we're building the piping to do other things. So, hey, what kind of car do you have? We have a virtual garage. So we'll say, Alex, which car are you shopping for? We have these three cars in the garage for you. And then you can fix or we're using customer data in that AI experience. And then we take it to our catalog. And we can match for that car that we selected, which tires in our catalog match that. So you have both general world information feeding the AI, along with customer personalization and Walmart data that's supporting them. So we're in the, I just saw a fortune released there. They're a fortune AI 50 and Walmart's somewhere in the middle, 27 or 30 something. So the company is all about leveraging AI. And a government balance recent code is like, every job's going to change here. And you know, but we still plan to have, we said in three years, I still expect to have 2.1 million workers at Walmart. Like, we don't have a shortage of ideas. We'll just do more. So. Sound like you've seen a lot of experience at Walmart really, really willing to throw it away around to kind of determine where the market's going to go, and what's going to say to where I'm going to go to my team. How much would those conversations about, okay, let's throw it away into this, are about trends that you want to set versus competitive competitive. I think we have time for a little bit. That's a good question. I mean, I would say there's a good balance, right? I mean, we're super competitive. We like to do great things that way. But we also have a license, you know, as to, to like, enforce our culture into brain change, you know. So I'd say there's a good, a good balance with those. Anybody else have nowhere specific answer? I think we have time for like one more question. From a leadership perspective, like Jen and Scott, you have like shifted from department to department at like a higher level. And, you know, David and Madeline, you guys have kind of, you guys have like set rotations. And you only have, you know, for the rotations, you only have like a year to like, familiar, you know, make a difference, I guess. So like, what are the steps that you take to like, feel confident in like being able to lead your team when you maybe don't know anything about fishing lures at the, you know, like, what are the steps or who do you rely on to kind of jump into that without quickly, I guess. I mean, we're looking for leaders that have natural curiosity, right? And we intentionally put people in areas like when I was music fishing, I didn't know anything about fishing. And actually, you do that very intentionally sometimes because you're not knowing that area because you ask so many questions and also to learn with thisness, but also the question why we're doing things, right? And frankly, you know, it's, you know, our company's older now and we have had things in place that just may not make any sense anymore. So I think our goal is to not work alone, right? As a leader coming in, I don't need to know everything. I have a whole team of people that are experts. And so what can they teach me, what can I, from what background teach them? Our peers as well, we work in business units, so I'm working with inclusion. I have several peers that have all the other departments. We meet constantly, we have group chats on what is this new acronym, what is this new tool, what's going on, right? And I think that you just have to work with humility on, we don't need to know everything, right? It's not embarrassing if I don't know, right, but I'm talking about, but I'm not about to guess, because in our position, we make multi-million dollar decisions every day. And we can't let, you know, arrogance, you know, get in the way of, oh, I knew I'm the leader, I'm gonna make a decision, because I think that's what I should be doing, right? You have to admit what you don't know, and ask a lot of questions and leverage your resources around you to make good decisions for the company. I'd say, too, it just hasn't been an issue, as we've had people, whether be why you were not going to communicate through. They're able to come up to speed very quickly, they're just smart people, and so they're able to put their weight within a few months, I would say. Well, hey, thanks so much for letting us come and share, and I did luck with the rest of your class, your school year, and we'd love to see you at Walmart.
