  "text": "It was only semi-sleeved. You got the chocolate. Yeah, where those chocolate pieces are? Oh, it's great to see all of you. Let's go ahead and let's start with the work for it. It's going to be the offer today. Dear Father of Heaven, we thank you for this opportunity to be in the NBA program. We're grateful to be here at BYU. We're grateful to have such great people around us. Help us continue to learn from each other and from our professors. We pray for professors to be able to insight good, quality conversations, discussions, so we can learn effectively. We pray for peace and guidance as we seek internships. And we also pray for those that have been suffering lately around the world, especially in Michigan, that they may find peace and comfort. You've heard of these things. And thank you for our Savior Jesus Christ and do your own name and His name. And the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Thank you very much. Truly. All right, everybody. Quick and now, let's just do our blind use. So, the reminder that our next home work assignment is going to be coming out in the next couple of weeks. So, okay, so, next assignment is going to be a week from Saturday. Okay, October 11th, how many of you have now looked at the assignment? Okay, some of you have, some of you have it. Please just encourage you to do so. And now, something you want to do, like a little bit of climb on, you have to go visit places so don't procrastinate. Always start tackling it. All details are on the canvas, so please hop on there. If you have any questions, just reach out to me or from me or from our service. We'll try to help out. Is there any other announcements before we get started? Yes, please. All right, I send out a survey over national black. It's really easy. It's like you put your birthday and you're like favorite things. And if you have like a baby, do or whatever, we as like, you know, a presidency want to make sure you guys are like celebrated. It's like awkward to like be like, it's my birthday today. So, if we already have that information, we can celebrate you. But also there's an option to be like, no, I don't want to be celebrated. So like, so if you could celebrate it. You have to be like, so you know, half birthdays, or something. We'll figure something out. Or like an unbirthday situation. We're in a birthday party. But yeah, if you can fill that out, that's helpful. I think there's like 13 of you that have filled it out. So thanks to the 13 of you. Whoo! I have one. Lucky 13. I have another announcement. The student life team would like to remind everybody that we've got the MBA elective pitch event tomorrow at lunch. So make sure to come to that and look at electives. And then, if you haven't already, RICP can be an MBA fall festival. You can go to lunch. And... Where's the one at the top? The top three lunches? Yes. Where are you going? Where are you going? There was a problem with something. Yeah. It's right in between you. If you're walking up, you go past the temple and you're way up to rock-aided. Like, there's a house right under your left hand side right in between there. You know what it's like from a temple? Not necessarily. Right in there. Okay. Take a right. Yeah, send the address. I said, better hand. I'll go right down here. I'll go right down here. I'll go right down here. It's a nice sit-up. This is the direction. This is the direction. The RICP is the icon who sent it in our section. You have to know. Okay. Okay. Any else? Any company? All right. Let's get started. Last time we were together with the Antirvide. We were trying to walk through the Harvard Business Spring. We finished up our discussion on the trip. Within C Company, we talked about the processing of the state. We could see exercises to make sure we feel a little bit more comfortable. We could feel more comfortable now on the end of the day. Good. Please encourage you to memorize it. Get it down. Practice it. Make it a part of the culture here. Let's be known as the MBAs that really understand the financials. I understand. I had a boss who, on our team at Codagra, you would always push us. The new people coming in to get to know that document. You'd walk, I'd be walking across campus. And John is becoming this way. I'm like, hey John, he goes, hey Mike, which B&L? I'm like, come on. It's like, so gross sales might as well as net sales. Net sales might as well as Scott Tugood's kids. We gross margin. Gross margin might as well be our new PCM. It's like, good job. We're doing that in Jennifer. All right. And so we would just create a culture with our team to make sure that we really owned our business inside of now. So just for what it's worth, this is something that's going to help you. No matter what line of business or what field of business you're going to be going into. I'm just getting the finances to really help you. Please take it first and try to trade it that down. We also talked about some of the strategic things that we need to understand before we start making strategic choices. We talked about within C company before we start moving. We need to answer three things. Do you remember what the three things were? What's the first one? Do you remember? Who are we? Who are we? A formal perspective. You've known as the fundamental things. Who are we? And what business are we really in? We discussed that. We then looked at our super strengths. We call those strategic things. Good. Do we have a sustainable strategic competitive advantage? Again, it's easy to copy products. Really hard to copy the skills. And so do we have a super strength? The skills? Something that we do better than other folks around us. We talked about Southwest. Are they can turn around twice more effectively? Do you understand that? And then the last one. Before we make strategy, what are our goals? What does success look like? We don't understand these three things before making our decisions. We then talked about the importance of doing that for us. Because if we fail to do so, we get to run into blind spots. Happens all the time. In case you have an example, let me please make sure you do that homework. And make sure you don't just listen to yourself. Just look at others around you too. Get a nice clear perspective of what's going on and how it works. So that was C company. Then we migrated from company and we went over to consumer. Now, when we did consumer, we desktoped the comments a little bit about what we talked about and what we wanted to do. We went through a little bit more in depth on what do you think of these things? Science and graphic versus graphic. Epic graphic versus behavioral. And talked about why white soul, poor, really understand all these different kinds of students. Strategy is garbage in, garbage out. If you don't understand these things about your customers, about your company, about your channel, about competitors, you're really going to do yourself that it isn't damaged. So please, they should get good quality work, good research, ask good questions, and then we'll hopefully go to make better stride. We also talked about one of the most common mistakes that we make in business. It's when you focus solely when you think about seeing consumer. When you think about seeing a user, when we talk about that, we should never do that. We need to look at the blind center. We look at all. So let's just, let's just review it really quick. What do users do? They do. They can sue. That would be easy. Okay? What do buyers do? They purchase and they negotiate. They also usually figure out which vendors they want to look at. It's a little bit multi-tier there, but it's important to understand that they are the ones that are going to be showing out the money. Okay? What about influencers? What do they try to do? They're suede. They try to persuade you. That's their goal. They want you to align with what they're thinking. They all just try to persuade each other all the time. Today we'll be doing some persuading in this class. Okay, but that's something that's really important. Now, what's the difference between an influencer and a gatekeeper? What a gatekeeper's doing. They're technically saying it louder. They shield. They shield. They limit options. They limit access to the buyer. So where influencers, where influencers are kind of playing offense, gatekeepers kind of like defense. Does that make sense? They're the balancer of the nightclub. If you're on the list, you get in. If you're not on the list, you're not going to get in. Does that make sense? Okay. And then last but not least, the sideers, what do they do? They're like the final decision. The final decision. Usually it's your boss or your boss and boss. They're not deciding for it. Okay. Questions on the buying center at all? All right. Please. Oh, yeah. You've got an example of an influencer versus an a gatekeeper. That's not the one and down the one. Yeah, sure. Did I give you an example of this on my first one? Is it that? Yeah. Remember the internet? I don't know how to show it. Okay. So as an influencer, I tried to persuade my kids to make a choice in the morning. As a gatekeeper, I put up parental controls to keep them out of things hopefully that they decide not to listen to my influence. Does that make sense? Yeah, I guess I'm just struggling in terms of like a buying perspective. Also buying, marketing products. Sure, sure, sure. So let's say that I am a buyer or a monster. I sell shoes. Okay. And let's say that I look at all as a buyer, I look at all the different shoes applies around the world. How many shoes applies do you think there are around the world who love new business at the moment? At least six. At least six. At least six. So let's say probably hundreds that bear across the world. Okay. Now it's a buyer. Do I have time to go and buy them with all hundreds of those people? No. So as a buyer, what I'm going to do is I'm going to narrow things down. I'm going to look at the vendors. They're going to kind of align with what I'm trying to do for my brain. Respectives, quality, all listening consumers, all listening influencers, people in my company. And eventually I'm going to narrow my hundreds of companies down to 12. These are the 12 suppliers that I want to do business with as a buyer. Does that make sense? I then go to my boss's boss and say boss, here are the 12 that I want to do business with. Boss's tips is 12, quite a few. Let's throw them in 10. Here are the 10 that I'm signing off. That boss is now about to get it. He decided on what's finally approved and who we can do business with. I didn't take that 10 and I used to do my administrative assistance and said okay. You know all those people that call all the time trying to get in and trying to pitch their business? Yes. Would you please limit it to these 10 people? In fact, proactive we reach out to these 10. Let's hold the gate today. Anybody else that calls? I'm sorry but we're not taking new credit. What is that administrative assistance doing? We're the bales who are outside the nightclub. Does that make sense? Is that how? Yes. A little bit like that. So the influencers could have introduced the consumers. Other consumers say hey you know what you find out? So they could be people and they thought they could be a prior buyer. They said hey I worked with these people and they were really really great. It could be as you saw or on the branch side of the businesses. It could be funny and say you know what we do to this company the more than either of you. You're looking at this. You're still. If you have a relationship, say hey these folks are good but they never deliver what they promise they're going to do better. So they don't want to do that. So anyway, anybody can do the relationship. Okay. That's all? Yeah. Yeah. In that example is your boss not also a gatekeeper? Because he's keeping out those two that you are analyzing the business. No, because the gatekeeper usually is not an order to take. This gatekeeper usually doesn't make the decision when it gets in and it gets out. They usually just take the order and ensure that it's being a block. I got you. So that guy's owner has provided the answer with the list. That's right. You might have. Debraxets? Yeah. So the buyer has given the list to the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper says you're in. Yes. Go ahead. You're out. Sorry. Okay. All right. I'll give you one of those example. I can give you an interesting thing. From an MBA perspective. I'll do it's quick and then I can give you a moment. When I was recruiting MBA students when I was in industry. I ended up going to a recruiting event at the end. It was the opening weekend where you first get to meet everybody during orientation. I met this young woman who seemed really sharp. Really sharp. We talked quite a bit before and then she said she goes, hey, I said, are you interested in Conever? She was yes. I've already put my resume in. I hope you guys will. I hope you can jack. I think it would be a perfect fit. Here's why. She does a great homework to a real sharp. So I went back to my hotel at night and I looked at the list of students that I have that I'm going to be interviewing the next day and her name was not on there. So I reached out to HR in the morning before I left. I said, hey, I met this young woman last night. She seemed to really, really sharp. Did you see something in her resume that made you worried? Is there a reason why I'm not going to meet her with her tomorrow? She goes, oh, let me take a look. She looked at it and she said, oh, yes, she's got a great resume. But she only has two years of working experience. We'll only talk to the black students. So she was HR at the time of the beginning. They limited access to the recruiting environment. That's it. All right. So let's make sure we're going to go see my office. What could be the office? Let's not be my office. Let's really make sure that we look at the entire buying center when it comes to our consumers. Now, when you're reading, you have a chance to read about influencers. What are some of the things that the insight, because I call it that we have time to do this last time. What were some of the insights that you've heard about influencers and breeders, please? First, kind of a mess, then usually a regular, with a couple of influencers with smaller, smaller, or smaller, yeah. Wasn't that interesting? How many of you have surprised you? Some of you are not. Some of you are going to be getting in there. Yeah. What was the difference between that two? Yeah, at least. It seemed like a lot of the smaller influencers, if I remember this right, it was like they looked for people that were already using the product or that already maybe had some sort of affinity to it. A connection in some way? Yes, and then use them instead of like, so you're finding someone that uses your product to advertise it instead of finding someone with a lot of followers and sending them a new product that they never use that. Okay, so let's just, you as a consumer, put on your consumer app for a second. Does who pitches a product you matter? Okay. What? So you look at Macro versus the Nano, what were we talking about? Why does one send more effectiveness? I trust certain people on their payments over others, so I will keep looking and buy and trust them on regular basis. I don't really care what some celebrities do, it might be cool, but you may not be relevant to your own. Yeah, so firstly gives you recommendation. Is she going to use, you might trust that recommendation a little bit. I'm not sure. Okay, other people, yeah, please. I kind of keep the word influencer, you know how it's used today, not in this sense of polite, so for me, the influencer is like, that's awesome that you got that mattress that they sent it to you for free and then you move yours out of your rooms, you could unpack this one and take a video, you set up everything and then you took it back out for your own mattress back in because you just put money. It's like, I don't, I don't people like that, so I think the smaller people or like the people who actually have reason to promote the brand. For example, I was in this podcast four times a week, covered in massage roles and the guy is funny because he sponsored by Kim Kardashian and his skin, so they make me another part. And he talks about like, yeah, I love this underwear because remind me of what I would wear the jeans, like basketball and I do all the things and he likes wear it. And so he just like kind of, he does the ad read that are just him like, I think it was pretty sweet, like he's, he's my name, so he wanted to do this. So to me, that's interesting, not, hey, they paid me, you know, to market. So why don't we just do netted? I mean, is a Kim Kardashian is someone like that a benefit? Buddy, you're not getting the wide broad facts that you need to kind of establish your being out there. In a certain sense, it's beneficial when a brand sounds familiar, when a nano info to bring it up and then with that person, you get more cats in real life. I think it's a, I think you'd be surprised at the pseudo relationships people think they have with celebrities, you know, like I think TikTok and all these things make you feel like you're closer and that you can trust these people, right? Like I'm influenced all the time by celebrities and, and like you feel like you have this relationship with them. So I think that while the nano probably gets more of their audience to purchase, I think that you'd be like the wide breadth influencers are labeled that for like people do buy what they use because they want that life or they want to be, you know, if I buy this concealer, I will look like the Kardashian. Like that's the goal. There's some street cred that comes with the mass sometimes, right? Please. I think it all depends, like, page of saying, kind of on your strategy. Am I doing this for brand awareness? And I go with the Kim Kardashian, because you have the broader reach. Do I want to drive purchasing than I may go for the nano? Yeah, how important does it to understand your strategy before you make your choice? You're right. We talk about advertising. There's some ads that are all about acquisition. There's some ads that are all about retention. That, oh, influencers probably will mean heavily on the attention and developing this more of those more thorough relationship. You can also be hard and deploy about this capital. Good hand. So if you have like a technical or you know the budget, it's hard to find some thousand of those. Or if we're like, I think, you know, $10,000 to account. Yeah, and think about the handhold that you're going to have to do if you work with a thousand nano versus one macro. So should you understand C company before you make your choice, what you have the resources to do? Please. As you can say, ideally, they're not mutually exclusive either, right? Like I do, you can find that if you search hard enough, you can find a big person. Or if you get a micro influencer early and build that relationship, all of a sudden they become a big name influencer. That's right. You still have the recognition there. Yeah, and how cool is it that if you have a relationship as a corporation, some of it is nano, it is a developed and become a big name. How genuine that still can feel and be. And that student will have the last section to talk about that their influence actually respond to their comments when they post it. It's just a nice time. When you have like a small, you know, influencer's small community type of thing, people are more, they want to support that person because you know, they're having a harder time with somebody like the connection or whatever. They're trying to make a name for themselves. Yeah. I talked about it before, but I played competitively in a long time. And there was a tournament that was sponsored by some mobile game and it was like, oh, we'll add $10,000 to the prize pool of this tournament if we get, like however many downloads. And people were happy that I'm with the app, but then they didn't see anybody stick with the app. And so the next time they sponsored a similar tournament, it was, oh, now you have to play through the introduction of the game. And then like Melinda, the vice, they just, they're just a little bit of people who are so dear to support that they didn't necessarily care about the content of the matches. Yeah. And what you're trying to accomplish really, really matters and something you have to think about that before we start moving forward. I'm just wondering how solid is the influencer economy is going to be because, yeah. Yeah. Because because there's a thing like you think the tech topic, you take talking big here now in the US, you should see how tech topics big in China. The, they market online and heavy on the tech topic and sometimes I get ads from different influencers, same as every day, I get annoyed. And then there are influencers that makes, I think one night, the top one may like $90 million US dollars overnight. And just based on sales and commissions. And now it's the influencing young generation to gold there, to the gold reference, that gold for like four forms. Oh, it's going to be really, it's going to, I think you're right because it's going to say the jack thing about when I started learning about influencer, which probably about 20 years ago. Well, I went to a lawyer who talked about how you knew about every trends of the topic, his personal marketing, gender, high schools. And they would actually go for ambassadors from junior high school. How did you find it? You look at the year books and find out who's in this club, who's in this store, who's in this, whatever. I think so. You get permission from the brand and they go all in to wear that sweater or that perfume or cool, or whatever. Now, is it all a little bit since then? Yeah, I know. Just a little bit. And the reason why is because it can be very accurate depending on your strategy. I mean, in some instances, you go out there and there's nobody like to work on that, oh, and micro influencers. There was no upflow, there are no companies out here creating the smaller, smaller influencer world. But because you get such a dramatic difference, so we talked about ROI. Remember, last time? Look at that. $50 spent, $1000 gain. That worth a while. If you're a finance person, is that going to make you go, hmm, okay, maybe? Let me just do it. Yeah, now all of a sudden, now all of a sudden people care about your budget. Remember we talked about that article? Let's get bring it down to what people really care about in business. Now, when you start talking about the macro, look at that. And you're still getting a nice uplift, right? The ROI is still solid, but relatively. So having these in your back pocket, understand into P&L and the profitability implications for your choice. It helps you sell the strategies of the top look at it. But again, understand what success is like at the front. If I'm all about deepening the relationship, I don't know if I'm going to go put macro all the time. If I'm all about generating awareness, I don't know if NANO is going to be the right strategy. We thought, okay? So think about those different elements. Now, influencer marketing is continuing to get bigger and bigger. And I just want to show you a couple quick facts. This is this is old data. I think even 10 years ago, this was true. Seeing content once credibility and trust was only 6%. Okay? Does that sound about right to you? If you see a headline or some kind of a tweet or something on Facebook, how many of you now doubt first before you believe? Yep, that's what the study shows. But here's the key thing, that second line. Even if it's from the same source, you just have to get a little bit of repeat. And all of a sudden, you 10x that credibility. Think about Sunday. How many of you in your first saw a tweet about the shooting? How many of you first had doubts? And then when you saw it here four times, how many of you now are like, dang it. That happens. And depending on your credit, this is on average, right? So depending on how trusted you are as an influencer, that's obviously a lot. Depending on who it comes from, that obviously go out and fix it. But I mean, you understand this is really important. Here's the next thing I want to show you. Now influencers, now even rivals out of friends. Especially a lot of people in the line of session. The line of users. It's kind of crazy, huh? Yeah, it's crazy. And I think that the reason why it's on my channel, you didn't advertise with a influencer. I think of Hello Crush, I've seen it. Which many times will be even more than product. Yeah, there's always going to be some wear out. The Tee Gover Tullet. What it is, it's going to be really very uneven on making a thing. And I'm certain that the categories have to be higher than others. But yeah, there's always going to be some more. But I mean, rule of thumb. I was advertising. And we always wanted, when I was in brand, we always wanted to make sure that our ads were watched at least four times. Once we got four times, that seemed to be the sweet spot after that we started any commission. So think about that because you're making your choices. Now, great believe today that we live just like CRM, there's a lot of companies that are shooting the social media airways. Do you understand what the influencers are saying? Newbie was a company that started up here in Utah Valley. I got a lot of traction and ended up being the number one social media scraper across all of PR for America. They've sent sold it to another company. I'll show you that in a second. But they really ran to do some cool things. This right here, you can pull up a brand. You can pull up the brand that you're interested in. And Newbie would be able to go and harvest all the social media posts out there in the Twitterverse or back in the TwitterVisual Facebook or Insta or whatever it is. And then what they do is they would do a live stream. So this is noon, one, two, three. During this time, you have all these bubbles that are constantly just slowly moving across your screen in real time. And if someone says something positive, you would have a green bubble that would pop up knowing that something positive was said about your bench shoes. The size of the bubble represented the size of their influence. So if Oprah or Ellen DeGeneres back in the day or in the year, you would find, you would find that, if you could do a live stream and make it into a big bubble and then say, this is really cool. And then what they could do is they could actually figure out where those posts were coming by zip code. And so politicians that saw this, and they're like, wow, this would be really powerful. We'd love to be able to look at the zip code. Can you get us all the tweets that are going out and all the social media posts going out in a straight neighborhood? And before they would go out and do town halls, they would work with newbie Dennis Daniels, who said it's really powerful stuff. And so now a company called Reputation is purchased newbie. They're not the only ones that play in this world now. There's actually some really good companies. And you can see with now the world of AI. Now I'm going to show you this whole more time. Notice how much blue there was. That means that it was neutral. They couldn't tell if it was positive or negative. But the green you could tell and the red you could tell. Now notice the difference now. How much more green and how much more red you can see. With AI and other capabilities, it's getting better and better reading what the intent was behind the post. And so there's a lot of things you can get reports and all this other things. So this is the very powerful tool that's out there. Netbase is another one that's really really big right now. Chris and hexagonal and another one that's great for social media. Just know that you have YouTube monitor, influencer, you need to know your path. Right? Just know this real thing. Grace, did they like hard movies, social media sites? And they're like, what's that? Yeah, it's a very good question. I also want the new ones behind it. Does anybody know? Most of the social media sites have great idea. So I think it's all the way down to the top. Thank you. Not all of them. Like you talked about here. It's important to see. So anyone, just know that there's a lot of tools out there for us to be able to make those decisions. Seriously, what's at our hands right now between AI and all of those things are out there. Pretty powerful stuff. Do we, we are used to have art tools to any of these social media scraping? Not that I'm aware. I know that Newtie came in and tried to pitch to us. I think it was beyond our marketing budget. So folks, don't forget about all these different players. Influences, obviously, when we do the same thing and have a deep discussion on everyone in these different players. Don't forget about seeing the consumer. All right, dive in deeper. What do you do? Now all of a sudden, it becomes really, really meaty. As I mentioned last time, one of the projects I did when I worked with Adobe is we actually done this in the buying center for that. And we looked at each one of these different players that we were just talking about. We looked at each one of these different players and who, if they're going to try to sell to a business to business corporation, who are they? And what did they value and what roles did they play? If they want to pitch this, who are the right folks? What's the right messaging? And they're doing some solid market research. We were able to actually able to create proposals for an analysis to display. So here's just one snapshot of one of the players. So this was the vision leader. This is what the ER EVPs, directors of marketing usually this person was influencer. And so when you look at, here's the snapshot here, what they do here, the insight she need to know upfront. Here's what motivates them. Here's where it is when they buy, we're going to get into this a little bit later. And then I'm going to take these and now I'm going to start looking at the things that trigger and what they measure for success and all these different things. If you have this on each one of these buying centers, can you imagine all the strategic insights you have and what that can mean potentially for generating sales? How can Adobe and Microsoft help them? Well, here's what they potentially value. They're trying to challenge their trying to face each day. They have all these talking points down the sales. And in that shell, here's what it is. So be thoughtful. Day gets an only. He'll act the only thing. Garbage in, garbage out. And the more you understand, the more I can change the answer. Now we get a chance to learn a little bit about how to be thoughtful and all that. How many of you have actually used or know what? Yes. For this case. Yeah? Where are you from? How's the name? Are you from Argentina? Since you know us we're in. Yeah. Are you good? I've been a consumer of. No. But my wife, yes. Please, what? Is it like it? It's more common in people. Maybe that doesn't have a format of it. Yeah. Okay. Very good. Well, this is a really interesting story. Okay. So let's talk just a little bit about a wall. Let's kind of step back. This case was just kind of interesting. There's a lot of stuff free 2017 to decision that it fast forwards. You don't know what happens for four years. You know, they said they're just successful companies. And we're just trying to build a way to happen. That's what happens. So we're going to talk about that. So let's go free 2017. And let's start talking a little bit about the changing situation over in Argentina. What is the changing situation that looked like in the 2017? Down. How about the current things? Good. Not a lot of people use banks. How much? 40%. 44%. Now, compare that to the United States. When we... 40% of the money? 40% of the money? So, pretty different? Yes, significant. Anybody want to add anything else? Part of the government's fees and the government's smart筆. Or in Argentina, which are for every type of transaction or having certain types of accounts. And I think it's culturally or in a tradition that holding money and these family friends are always good at it. Good. So I mean, we're in a place. We're in a country where historically, quite a bit of economic up and down. Is that fair? Inflation can be issues and times. There's been government changes over the time. Policy's changed. And there's just a lot of uncertainty in the market. There's a lot of mistrust to the banking. And so, you do have a lot of people that have their money. They just cannot hold on and they save it, push it with it. They use a lot of cash. And they behave. The consumers are being a little bit different. So, how else do they behave? Can you give us an insight a little bit? How else do the consumers in Argentina, at least? They used, probably 2017, different than maybe here in the States. And you can just refer to the case too. No, I am thinking in the use of cash every time, yeah, it's normal. Even now in Argentina, you use even sometimes dollars. That's right, they talked about that, right? Knowledge was kind of the choice of currency at times. If you have to buy a car in Argentina, you pay with dollars. Do you really get the same money? Yes, you do weird. Other things that are weird are many, many people have dollars in their own house, in cash before, in the bed. In the bathroom, yeah. So, you really start, you start to, maybe your grandpa died and you look at the church. And sometimes you find money, yeah. And this is related, because in 2000, we had big releases. In the banks, many people lost their savings. That were in the banks. Yeah, they did push something. Something called Corralito is black. It's a language story too. So, you can see why there's just trust. I mean, if you've lost, if you've been bit before, we lost trust in banks. I think it's fair. So, I had the term of insurance in Argentina. I was there in 2013 and 2014. And the biggest contrast that I noticed is that kind of considered the same. I know what's, if you were to ask someone how much they make, they were planning to make a month. Not how much they make a year. And on the first of every month, everyone's, like, the line of the ATM would be like, clear down with a lot. But the other crazy thing is, all the lot of it there, you're in a half or so. The transaction fee, the draw money, like 10x. It's just any year and a half. And so they actually, our mission had to start giving us extra money to cover that. Because it was starting to make enough of the difference that it was like having that amount of money. So, let's build on this really quick. Let's talk about some of the banks that are there. These are a few of the historic banks that they talked about in the case you recognize these banks. How did, let's talk about that. How did they view consumers? They stopped the case. What, how did they view consumers as a source of money? Yes. And evidence five. And evidence five, in fact, that they didn't come on back about anything. And they were creating a firm like the right, like 10x more than other 10x. Yeah, what did you think about that? Are these banks profitable? Yes. Significantly more profitable than a lot of others. A lot of other things. How does it, as a consumer, can you do that? How'd that be? Probably a little bit of a loss. I thought it was interesting that I mentioned that they were the only focused on brick and mortar branches. And they were all fashionists who didn't care about it. They were all focused on the right. That's right. We're going to do banking system our way. We're going to charge what we feel is right. And how important is that for sure? Sure. In my last class, in the last exam, we also put the margin today. You said if you went to the bank, you'll spend up at least half a day. Can you feel that? Yeah. Maybe two hours. Yeah. So I also surfered my mission in our container. And I was in the office there at one time. I remember why the company had to go on to the bank to withdraw actual like less dollars from the bank instead of the pesos. And it was so confusing how to do it because of one specific thing for that entire city. For that company, they had one branch of bull city that had the US dollars. They had to go there. They had to get in line to meet the right spot to get in line again. I even thought it would spend four or five hours just going through that whole process. I could actually get what we would drive a cab. This is a really, I mean, is it consumer? This is not very consumer friendly. Imagine if you've gone and lived abroad. And now we're back to that. Now I'll challenge you. Now frustrated. Now it might be pricing. We'll talk a little bit about that. And I'll be extraordinary fees that they would charge on everything. And then from a technology perspective, they were stuck in brick and brick. And did they introduce some technology? Yes, they did. But how effective was it? Now, they share about it. So if there's a need out there of my consumers, and if there are profits to be made, what does that generally happen? What happens to generally in the marketplace? Competition comes in. Good, Amin. So we got competition that starts coming in because there's a lot of people. It's like, you know, Mr. Potter. This is when I was reading, it was like, they're like a bunch of Mr. Potter's. I don't know if that's accurate, but if you haven't seen this from a wonderful life. Mr. Potter, you know, we always made these hard times to make these nice consumers. So you think that was right. Okay, so now all of a sudden new competition is coming in. In France, France looks at this and said, you know what? We're a big brick and mortar store. They're not going to take advantage of it. We're going to. So instant, there comes a little bank. A little bank comes along, becomes pretty successful. So horse will make comes in. It says, hey, we're one point two. And then when they got in there, we're successful. And all of a sudden, you got Spain coming in saying, hey, BBTA, here we go, we're going to play two. And we're going to introduce now more easily used credit cards. This could be a nice change. Then they started doing that. They introduced these new things. And that, they don't have to send companies without brick and mortar, saying, hey, we're not playing. And so, maybe we'll just do mobile only. And so all of a sudden, folks from Germany start coming along. And 26 comes around. They have brick and mortar in Germany, but they didn't in Argentina. And then Brazil came in and came out with new bank. And then the UK came in. I mean, you've got all these different players that are coming in trying to fill an unmet need by the Argentinean consumers. Then, because I was so profitable, now you have people that aren't even in the banking system coming in. Digital banking enables communication terms to come in. So you've got Orange Bank coming in. And then you've got Wee Bank coming in. I mean, they're not even banks. But they recognize that there's a service that they can make money. And it's not being built by the Argentinean banks. So they should be managing it. So imagine if you're a consumer from Argentina, you've got a lot of oil, teach your country. You love your country. You love the people of that country. You've lit the broad. You see what they can be and how different it is in some countries versus others. And so that introduces to this gentleman right here. Okay? How do you pronounce his name? You had a palo, no, I had a beardie. Yeah. You had a palo? You had a palo. You had a palo. You had a palo. He's telling me that's that word in the name. He's telling me. He's telling me. He's telling me. Mr. Rivera. I'm going to tell you what's in the name. Okay. Mr. Rivera-Berry comes in. Now, tell me a little bit about what his vision for banking is. Tell me about what he's seen. First, I tell you a little bit about how he goes back. Get good. I'm just going to get back up and just getting back. And you really cared about the impact on society, like access to finance and being able to sort of like have access to the money that you're going to work about. Like, you know, you're just going to have to have a financial or something like that. Yeah, he learned that if funds with dollars and funds and money are available to the people, the less extreme things might be made. And so he believed in this and he'd seen the history. He'd seen the shortfallings. He said, man, wouldn't it be great if we thought about banking and doing that? Okay. So he decided to explore this new type of banking system. And what I love about what he did is he sat down on the four-sided banking system. He kind of laid out what his fundamental entity was. So was he just another brick and mortar bank wannabe? What if he want to stand for? What business did he want to be in? Like access. In the monetary access business. That's a good way to find anybody else want to add to that. Customer service. Customer service business. I think that's fair too. I mean, referencing another bank that I think he drew from was that Brazilian bank that said, finally you're in control of your own money. Good. Yeah. It's kind of dependency, right? Being able to go into an enterprise and having it your own way. He wanted people to be able to add up in these banks to gains and confidence and be able to go and make an institution here within his country that he loved. And it should be something a whole group of people else into their lives. That's what he wanted. So he went out and he hired some great people. He thinks people don't like to know what they look like. He didn't really do that. These are really the people that help build this company. And Mr. Barbarian, he went out. I probably would be thrashing that in too much time. He then knew what he wanted to stand for and then he said, okay. I've done some research. You understand C Company? Does the understand competition? Yeah. Does the understand the consumer? This is a channel maybe not as critical here. So he looked at these and he said, okay. Time for me to start making some stringent calls. Did anyone notice the process that they went through as you were reading? Did it sound familiar at all? Did you notice they went through the who? Then the what? Then the how? I'm probably sure I'm not trying to teach a false doctrine. But the thing that they did, and this is exactly what we did teaching. It did sports these first. Now he's getting to who could we, who should we and what are we going to say? And then how are we going to do it? So that's what he started the idea next. And he wanted to understand more about this consumer. So the way they started looking for, like we said, garbage and garbage out. He wanted to really make sure he understood them. And he created different segments. And he didn't even notice the really segments in the back end. You see your head is seen? You see your head? Hey, I read these out last night. So there's a typo that I followed that. But these, you've got six potential segments that he could go to business with. I want you to look at these and you might think about who would, if I were him, where would I place my bets? If I wanted to build a company and build a successful bank here in Argentina, where would I go? Here's a separate segment. Second one, number one, was the 10th of the population. These are people that have no prior banking experience. Okay. 24% have a smartphone. And 41% have access to the internet. Okay, with mobile. They're highly social, rural areas. They're relying on an informal economy. You're looking at the trade. You're helping your family. The Russians go into a bank. They jump from small jobs and they look for immediate rewards. Their banking means they, if they did do it, it would be deposits of a draw money. If the bank is considered safe. And then I average 57% to 26%. Okay. Do you have a few for it? Second, number two, more than the bidder. Now I'm talking about another quarter of that. The value source is also a very low banking experience. If they have, maybe the inactive bank account or they were rejected by one of those big banks, because they didn't have the assets. But maybe that's a 28% smartphone. And 58% smartphone. So more than double that of second one. And much better on the mobile usage. They focus more on family and friends. So if any more for a moment, the value source and venture inter-inventing takes away some risks. They will, if they did do that, they could go to a deposit and transfer and withdraw. They make a payment occasionally and they even make a payment. Okay. A little bit older, just a couple years. And you can see kind of the income that they use. And I think that was a promote. And it was acknowledged. It was true. Second to the degree, 36%. Third to pop. Modern banking. So they had it before, usually for savings, deposits and transfers. Look at the small and the smart phones. These are new families, usually unemployed. And usually kind of the challenges of life right now are higher. The value of poverty. If they did do banking, they did borrow money. Just keep going this time. They're like maybe saving a little bit and preparing those big events. Get a little bit older. 35%. And the board. A little smaller, 8%. Modern banking experience. 61% smartphone usage. Now we're talking about the entrepreneurs. These are growth mindset people. They value their kids' education. They want to make sure that they're going to be helping them in their life. They like to invest, but they want steady, conservative investment. And they don't want to put a lot of line here. A little bit older, 45% usually. 75% smaller. 5% but these are the banking experts. They're also having investing. They have a lot more money. Notice the difference down here, 60 to 200. 81% smart phones. They like to show off. They like their money. They take pride in their success. And they also are always up for investment tips. And then the last one is 16% population. These also make quite a bit of money. Banking is a regular experience that you can have multiple banks. They're in real estate. 80% almost smart phones. They're a burst of risk. As they save, they make money. And they definitely put some in the known financial problem. Different consumers. Different psychographics. Different behaviors. Different ethnographics. Different demographics. Notice we got all these different levels for consumers. Okay, so now, this is what we could do business with. And we could actually, should be hard. So, as you went through, you're Mr. Marbury, how would you go about this? Who would you focus on? So, to simplify what you're going to do, I think that some of these are fairly similar. Not a group of couple of people who are interested in this. So, let's say if you looked at this and said, I would go and use your segment one or two. We'll call that segment B. Or, through your four, we'll call that segment B. Or, the ones that really understand it, I'm going to call that segment C. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to talk about the why is it the why-nots of these different segments? So, in this class, I would have to view a blind vote before. Yeah. Just again. So, I want you to look at this and view for a second. I'll begin with it. Which one would you pursue to build the wall? Which one? You could do it. The group that you need, the upside that you need. Which one would you go? Now, you'll notice that I've got A and blue. A and blue. B and yellow. And C and pink. So, we're going to go and find out. We're going to have to make a choice. Or, where do you think I'll go? So, we're going to put your hand up, hold your eyes. Okay. This will take a few minutes, so we'll be patient with this. If you believe that Mr. Burberry should go with the segment one or two, in other words, A, please open your hand. Okay. If you believe that you should go with section B, please open your hand. Second, three or four, section B. Okay. Okay. If you believe that you should go with section C, please open your hand. Okay. Go ahead and open up your eyes. Okay. If you're going to twice, I didn't know we did that. So, I didn't know what you wanted. I didn't know what you wanted. It's all the yellow. You can do that. Yeah, I can do that. You're messing with this interlude. All right, there we got it now. What I want you to do is I want to put your card by mixing your name. Put it around. You got this good. There's balance. Yellows were the heaviest. All of my blue, all of my things. Now, strategy. It's all about choice, but it's also about why and why not. So, let's talk about this really quick. So, when it comes to evaluating segments, what dimension should you prioritize in making these decisions? A lot. So, what you have to think about this, let's talk version about section A. Okay, group A. Okay. Let's talk about why did you choose group A? Give me the why. So, I always think it should be segment two and segment three. So, I was running smart, but I looked primarily at smartphone usage because since it's a mobile space situation, you want to use that. So, you've got to make sure that they have the tools and their stole. And they kind of do the poor shape part. Okay. Thank you. Others, yes, please. I looked at that, but I also was looking at their banking experience and there's so many other banks already competing for these people. And so, I thought it might be a little easier to get into these people who don't totally, like they're not already invested in the bank. So, it would be less of a situation. So, competitively, you've got your core seeds. You know that they have deeper pockets in you. You know that there's a red ocean around you. And you're going to say, let's just avoid the competition. Maybe it'll be easier. This looks a little more brilliant. Okay. Got a more blue ocean strategy. Okay, others, yes, please. Joseph. I think this is similar to I'm thinking, I just think that people who have chosen not to use traditional banking. So, they have, that's what we're trying to step in and create a bank that's being made to trust with these issues for them. And I believe that people who have been really stepping in and like becoming the people who have our new bank interests now. So, Joseph said something that's really interesting. That's what we wanted to do. Maybe about that. And maybe I'm reading too much of this. Maybe I'm reading ahead of what they will decide or decide to do. But from my perspective, he wants to disrupt banking. He wants to create something that's easy to use, that has those fees, is approachable and that people trust. And so, I think that these are the people who feel those pain points the most so much so that they've decided not to do it. Okay, so he's saying, look, if we're going to be going out there and trying to accomplish the mission that we have mission we set out, which is regain trust in banks, why not go to the people that don't trust banks? So, we can win them over then maybe. Yeah, this can be successful. Okay, it's a really good point. Thank you. Other, yes. So, the likes I value might be a little bit longer. That's interesting. Others, yes. I like what Joseph was talking about. And they'll be not for that. They're also unlike the customer service business. That's not least how I read it. And so, if you're going to reach out to a group of people that it's like don't trust banks, you can make them trust them. I like showing them how easy it can be. And so, where some of these other categories, they have a lot more experience. And so, maybe you'll come full with their current system. So, I think if you're focusing on customer service, it's interesting to see. So, you're saying, let's not have to retrain everyone. Let's go to people that haven't been indoctrinated in certain practices. And we don't have to re-teach them. Let's go to somebody who hasn't had the experience. That's interesting. Take another, please. Yeah, my thought was just focusing on like the 60 or 50, whatever percent that don't utilize banking at all. Because we're not trying to create brand switches. We're trying to create new users, I think. So, that was kind of my thinking and then kind of going, I forgot who was talking about, but you can influence the older generation. If the younger people are doing it, then you can kind of have that brand switching. Got it. Yeah, I'm just right. Can you change people's minds in consumer standpoint? Yes, you can. But I will tell you, it usually takes a long time. And it's usually really expensive. So, at your point, if we get somebody they trust, like a younger family member that gets it, might they be willing to listen a little bit more? Okay, so that's some good rationales. Is that good reason why we should potentially go this route? Yeah. Okay, now what are the downsides? Please. I am wondering, kind of like, what if they're not looking for a bank at all? Like just sort of like the segment of population where they're really relying on that informal economy. Like, it might not be addressing any of these areas because it's not really neat. So, it's not neat. Yeah, maybe we're just kind of making things up. Maybe they don't want things at all. Maybe they have just no interest. So, are we taking a risk and playing a gamble with somebody that doesn't even want to shop in the area? Right. I think it's fair. In order to stay in the business as a banking member, and borrowers like taking out loans, and that doesn't really matter. And so, it's a huge risk on like property loans options. So, we got all these folks right here. What would the traditional base think about that? Not worth it. They could be hopping up and down to get access. Is there just so profitable? Yeah, probably not, right? So, is there some truth there? I mean, is this a group that's going to be with the least? Is that something that we shouldn't do? You want to push back on that? We'll go back to the younger comments. Maybe they're not to that point yet where they needed to buy a home, but I think that was a girl who was like that. She's going to need to take out loans and get me high. So, it's a lot of opportunities there. Fair pushback. I think, I think, under the same name as well, like the democratic assembly, the social, like, after this entry to my area in Michigan, Mexico. I know maybe some of the things are hard to keep up with. It's really hard to scale up, which is why some of these times people attract these local countries, like, see their opportunities. And so, I think looking at those numbers, like the 35K income is 28K, and kind of like most of these people, I was even more probably looking at the paycheck to paycheck. And so, you know, with, I don't know what the transaction, because I can call it as a right-wing, I'm just going to use it with all of the time. I think there might be some, it might not be in this case, like, in the favor of being the action people, but it's going to be fine. But I think it's a really good point. It's a while. There are several reasons. I actually would have grouped two and three together, but since that was an option, size of a population, I think the market size is good. They have moderate banking experience, which I think, because you already understand banking, it's easier to use this mobile thing, versus not having any knowledge. If you don't understand banking, I doubt that you're going to jump into it. Let me try the mobile banking, if you don't even do traditional. Good. They have decent users' smartphone. And I think, based on kind of their life, psychographic and banking needs, they can use a bank more than other segments. They already need it more. So I think the pain for them is greater. They're going to the bank more, and they're waiting in line longer. They're pain is bigger. The other ones, they're going to look for solutions. And I also think, like, with the new families, for example, I also feel like they have a need, like, more of a risk, to be like, I need something that works, because I need a prep for my new child, or something. All those pain points they talked about. Money? When I was looking at it, I was mostly focused on, we were trying to be in the market, right? Yes. And so the idea is, is all of a sudden, it's going to be the need that needs to be used. So I think it's actually, yeah, you got, like, a smartphone usage. But yeah, the trend, that kind of type of thing that they're going about, is purely visual banks, and it's going to allow them to just work in positive or to drop cash. Right. First things, is that true? For most of them, yeah. Like, so far, when they first started, you could not deposit or withdraw, like, a check or whatever else. It wasn't until they gave all the deposits, and that's, you know, that's their results. So I'm going to push back on this case, and the reason why is, in the case, it talks about what companies they came in, and it's looking at what's going on in the corner. It's really good. Look at that. That's what people with cell phones, that's right. That's people with cell phones. That is true. That is true. That is true. You have to have that cellphone come up, you have not. And you're right. Yeah. And think about the licensing, the public, they also talked about it. Did you, some of the services of the bank, you have to be licensed, and you have to have some of these physical facilities. Do they have this as a law? No. So I think it's very push-up. Yeah, just thinking about the bear-up entry. Yes. With that kind of demographic, that they don't have those banking experience, it will be harder for us to move to them, with people who have moderate banking experience. For people with cell services, it's easier for us to provide little kind of services, and that ease the interest of other demographics, labor, which is by e-port and mile money, and one is all whatever. I think it's fair point. Okay, so let's go pink. Pink, why? They actually have money. They have money! Why are you calling that a drive? Why else? They got the systems, so they will be able to discern our competitive banking show where others are. Good. Are they giving the personal experiences that they need right now to present their banks? No. I mean, for a customer service, that's true. So is there an opportunity? Wow. I see kind of like, I think this product is really a low-end disruption, they're trying to come in and do things for the people or the low-end economies, but I see it to be like, you're going to test the model, but they're actually entering at the high end of the market, and we'll work their way there on the market. I don't think there's too little of a problem, but to get the adoption, I would rather get one of the second five, like one of those percent, and get them to adopt, and then have a lot of respondents that work, and then work down the market, and add features until the work of people come up. I think that's fair. Push. Go for a frag. All right. Just building off that, I thought the same thing where you can travel down much easier than you can travel up if you enter. That's it, yeah. Sure. On that same point, would it also be seen more as a luxury if we're trying to get the market, like, go overall keep a margin to the trust, and think more of it, like, the advantage is for the elite to not for us. It was just a thought. It was just a thought. Well, the downside. Hey, so are there other downsides that we go to the elites? They lead to have premium customer treatment in the box, so they even need these. So you feel like they're already being catered to? Yeah. Got it. That's it. Others? I feel like the only reason I didn't fix the, because I feel like this type of person, like, whoo, thanks, isn't super fun, like it's this. I think it was a barrier. I would take, if he would take a pretty good level of discomfort to actually make the move. And so, these people may just be a little too ingrained with what they're currently. Even if they're not super happy, is it really more like, 200,000, so I don't know. Okay. Anything else from Wallis perspective? Why? Why may they not want to go to Scraw? They're not the people that they care about. So it's really that. The vision that he has, right, is this idea of finding over money, is there people that control them money? They already have access to these things, like, yeah, but this was the best. When it comes to like, getting thinking service at all, they have that. So is understanding your fundamental entity and your business objective important to restore that huge community cost? Yes. So if I will all, I could, could this strategy, if I, if I will all, if I chose to go with being, could this be a very healthy financial opportunity for it? Is there a bit of a dental need with customer service? It could be a proof. Yeah. Do they have the money? The money. Yeah. But what does it do? It doesn't address why. Yeah, he's doing it. Is that something we need to consider? This is why we look and understand internally, why we do what we do up front. Now, when we start figuring out who we should target, understanding all these different things that we've discussed here is critical. And then once we have to stand who we're going for, now we go ahead and start carving a message out for it. So anger yourselves to that fundamental entity and then say, look, what does success really look like? Now hopefully that might help us understand which one might be the best fit for us. So for Mr. Barbarian, I want to notice this, right here, we are proud of the investor demand to be part of our store, which reaffirms their trust in our long-term vision of creating better and fair financial services for Latin America. Can you read into that what he's all about? What does success look like for him with all this cooperation? Is it just the dollars? So let's say that they've signed to position to banks. Is that decision going to impact your positioning message today? And is that message going to be very different than someone that is just getting into banking for the first time? Is that message going to be different? Or someone that's in the middle? Is that going to be different? This is why we go crew and then what we're going to say. Because if you try to stand for all things for all people, that's really difficult to be successful. Now here's the next thing you need to take a back. Once we go ahead and bank our positioning statement and we start executing, does that guarantee that we're going to have success? Absolutely not. So to achieve this objective to disrupt the market, what must really happen? We've got to acquire who? We have to get new customers. At the end of the day, we can't just say we've got to go do it. One of my favorite people in Rexburg, Idaho was a guy with an name of Preston Hayley. Just passed away last year. Preston was a football coach at our high school and then he became a football coach at what Rick's College. Back when we had a two year college, it was really difficult. Preston used to use this phrase all the time to football practice. Talk, cook, no rice. Okay? Can't just talk, you've got to go do it. So what must Mr. Arbery do? I'm going to share something that's really important and why should we really learn this? Strategic success depends on people, on warm bodies, people of falsehoods. You can have all the phrases in the world, but if you can't get consumers to do what you need them to do, you're not going to be a business girl. So this is a critical thing that I want each one to be learned. This is called a purchase sequence. Herd to sequence is a wonderful tool to help you diagnose why your business, how your business is doing. If it's working or not, working. And what it does is it also helps you verify and validate whether or not your idea has been verified. So let's say Mr. Arbery decides he wants to go with the early adopters, these people that aren't in baking today. And he understands the size of that population. And he determines if that market size is big enough to generate the returns that they need to meet their investors demands. You've got to have a forecast first, right? You've got to start with the people that are there. And this market size is critical. If you make a bad assumption, if you haven't done your homework and you're starting to launch this new product, but they're just not a consumer base there, really tough. So what we've got to do is we've got to make sure that we get that right. This thing goes through all of us do anytime we buy some. We are already in the market. We're one of the numbers. We have to be aware of the product. We have to like the product. We need to consider what it matters. Now we need to buy it. And then we're going to see if we're satisfied and then we might repeat it. Is that true for all of us? Is that true for every business? Yes. So let's just break this down. This is one of the tools that I learned in my MBA program that I kept on my wall in my office throughout my entire career. It's a great what-done tool. If you didn't heat your forecast, this is a really good way to look at it strategically. Figure out where it was felt. So I'm going to look at my market size. And understand that we have the right starting point for forecast in that group. Then I'm going to go out there and make sure that I say, okay, let's say there's a million consumers that I might potentially go for for you all. For you all in now, what percent do I think that I can actually get people on where of my products? That's a way I can. So I'm going to go for a moment. Let's say I get 50% awareness. Now I'm down to 500,000. Okay. From there, just because you're a wherever product, is that what you like the product? No. Now that positioning statement really matters. And what you choose to advertise and promote the old line share you're trying to get. Now it's about the... It depends if they're going to like you or not like you. Okay. From there, just because you like a product, and you're a wherever product, is that mean you're going to buy it? No. So just to give you a page, if I had two dollars, would you run out of the blue line and grab a soda for me? Sure. Okay. We're going to pretend there's two dollars. Okay. Now I want you to put yourself in pages shoes. Think about what you're going to buy me. Everybody got it? Okay. What are you going to buy me? Diet Coke. Diet Coke. I hate Diet Coke. Darn it. I'll take it. How did you start of the Coke product? I think you're going down to blue line. You better think of where Coke's cool. What about... What about like... How many of you thought Dr. E? There we go. I like Dr. E. How about I do? Anybody? Anybody like that, dude? I don't know. How about powering? Wooo! Very good. Okay. You know what I was told before? Good. Good. Janet did right. Oh, I love it. She's got a lot of money. Okay. How many of you know? How many of you are a peritone of Janet and Dr? How many of you thought about it right there? Okay. We have what we call a consideration set problem. Just because you're aware doesn't mean you're going to think about it when it really matters. I don't know. Are you going to be top of mind? That's very different than being aware. Do you consider it when it counts? From there, then you're going to go purchase it. And hopefully, you learned this... You'll remember that just because you consider it, even right down under shoppers, doesn't mean you're going to buy. Remember the AC Nielsen assignment you did? Maybe prices off. Maybe the competition's done something. Maybe it's not available. A lot of things that could stop the purchase. As you figure out what's done it. And then maybe they buy it, and then they don't come back. Maybe they're just satisfied. And then they don't repeat and fill the stride into product. Look, all of these are things that we have to understand. Now, here's why this is critical. Now you can start looking at the breakdown. If you think about that you're not performing well, and the wall is not being adopted, well, where is the breakdown? Can we buy Nielsen? Now, can we figure out what strategy we need to lay out in order to be able to fill this? Now, if you want to get even more fun, where's the breakdown on the buying center? So I shared you a little bit about Adobe. This is exactly what we did. Adobe has their own purchase-sequent terminology. Instead of awareness, they call it discover. Instead of perception, they call it explore. Instead of evaluating, they call it consideration set. Or consideration set of perceptions, value. Instead of using this purchase. But notice what we did. In this strategic opportunity, now I can virtualize two together. I can say, here's what needs to happen. Look whose playing those roles. And now I can really dive into each one of those consumer segments, link that to the buying center, and understand where we're looking at the fix on the purchasing points. And that's exactly what you did. So this isn't B2B, this isn't tech, this doesn't matter. Everyone of these players, you need to be able to understand and receive consumer. And then you can really start building rich rich diagrams and portfolio. Now, what's happened with the wallet? I apologize, I didn't wear out a ton of things. Just really quick. They decided to go with this one right here. Now that doesn't mean that everyone should be patting themselves on the backs. Because you could have been successful, I think, on the other group too. It's wide and wide out. They chose to go here. They decided that they're going to stand close here on the glute of size of your money as a positioning statement. And you know what happened. 2.7 million new consumers, and they got 6% share in four years. So excited, man. They chose the egg, the first two. Again, I think you could be successful on some of the others too. That's what they chose. It doesn't mean it's the only way to answer you. Okay, so he went out and decided to offer a card in the next person's picture. And really simplify the banking experience. They did not offer all banking services. They kept it just digital. They leveraged some nice influencers if you're going to pay for that dish. Now, the education now doesn't have an ever decision to make. How we can go over the next four years? So what are they going to have to do? Explain it. Now what? They're going to have to go all over again. We're seeing again. Great discussion, everybody. We'll see you next time. Thank you."
