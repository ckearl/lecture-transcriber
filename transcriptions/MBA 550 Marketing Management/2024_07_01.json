  "text": "You understand the economics of the oil. Recognizing that it isn't just in the US, it's a category of spread across everything. So consumers, business to business, it doesn't matter. The oil's eating drives problem. We also had a chance in order to develop a strong oil relationship and make sure you understand your business perfectly. So you can't like consumers. One of the things you'll get into is CRM systems. What does CRM stand for? Good. Custom relationship management. If you want to summarize Custom relationship management with three buckets, it's all about a query, consumers, retaining consumers, and then optimizing the profits. Those are the three key buckets of CRM. To get there, we can go out there and we can collect data in the CRM, that will help in our sales and our strategy of money. When we talk about that, there's a ton of different varieties of CRM systems. There's also, we also recognize that not all CRM systems are created equal. And so, understanding how we can dive in and understand how this strategically might help us solve a problem is really good. A lot of money there. Also, it gives us a chance to be able to recognize it. Even though our heavily-fogged looks at us all, it's equal. Sometimes, businesses, we may not look at each other. We want to make sure that we do business. We are nurturing those relationships with our most profitable ones. That's the goal. If anyone's not good, I'm not going to follow up the scales. I'm not going to say I'm not going to say I'm not going to crop my expenses. That's a number of requests. That's a good question. So, what we're looking at is if you look at this, the amount of profit that this particular segment is offered. If you look at the number one customers that make money, that number cuts these up. These are here, here, here, buying a ton of products. It's very profitable for you. This up to about 206. These are really profitable for folks. And if you get closer, once we get this kind of threshold with that, and you're 575 customers now, the second, these folks actually turn profit negative. They're costing you more to keep them in the system than they bring in. For this particular, yeah, and this is just one business. So, the idea is not all, I mean, look, you've got, like how much profit you're collecting on 200 consumers. And how big that is relative to the next 200, relative to the next 200, relative to the next 200. Not all consumers are created equal from the profitability perspective. And when we recognize who they are, what they value, now we can try to customize them, and now we can try to protect them and add value to them to the light. Does that make sense? Yeah. CRM helps us get there. Often we love to keep all of our profitable consumers, but it's the goal of business to keep all consumers. No. We've learned in our reading that it's okay to have different types of relationships with different types of consumers. That's okay. In fact, in order to get some consumers, if you go and bring in the first time, they are going to be profitable, because it costs a lot of money to bring in a customer through the first time. But then over time, that profitability will help people switch. Yes, please. Cheers. What changes this the most? The like, every business is going to have the number of the bottom are going to be ready. Where there are in like, what have you seen that business model that makes them the most amount of customers profitable? Or is it customer base? Like, there are a lot of inputs into this. I mean, do you take the amount of loyalty you have? The one that we kind of talked about last week, that's going to be mad at me. The amount of sales that you make. How often they come back. There's a lot that goes into it. We're going to talk a little bit later today on that equation. I will play a little bit. That fair? Okay. So understanding them is really important to understanding who they are. It might impact how we might handle a challenging situation like, hey, we don't have the inventory that we need. We need to protect them. So that's something we need to be careful of. And then also, there are consumers that we may not want to keep. So that's the key now is with Sierra's systems. We can tell them, thank you for your business, but no thank you for that behavior. And now we can customize. We can talk a little bit about how we can customize even through months. Just to give you a perspective of this. You know, when you talk about that in Humbay, I share that story with Fred Meyer. And how I told you today, I think that this would happen. And here's what. How many of you actually shop at a crore or a smitz or buns or around? Or any of those crore basis shop? Okay. A lot of you. Now, how many of you over the lifetime of the six periods have received the in the mail and envelope with customized coupons for you? Look at that. What do you coupons like? I think it's left over for my parents because they shop there. But they're always the at least one premium. Okay, to draw me in. And then everything else is customized for them. So since it's now shifted for them, mostly buying, I'll get free carnivates and then discounted free to the next one. And then just different products. A lot of protein. Yeah, a lot of protein. All healthy. Product 50 out of my state. That's right. Hey, good. What else? Who else? What's your own? Say, I get a lot of produce coupons for a while. I was getting free chip coupons back because I was on a chip thing for a while. But I'm getting eggs, even though I never buy them. So I'm confused about that one. And then another one unique to me. I guess I get the simple truth tofu there. And so I get kind of led to those products that I'm consistently. And when you received these customized coupons, how does that make you feel toward that organization? Oh, I only shop there. I do not step into a Walmart. How about you? Even though you've seen the end of the story coming up with your parents, how does it work? You recognize what you've got. Yeah, it's a little bit more of a world to me. And it's pretty stuff also making it well. I will find my other stuff on there. So it's interesting. When I compare my son's coupons to my coupons, I will get a free thing of ice cream. And some of the discounts that I get are a little bit more generous. They will send it to me. Why do you think that is? Because you spent more there, probably. I spent more. And I buy higher margin items. And so they want to reward that by giving me incentives to come back. My son still gets some good coupons. And they're tailored to him. But you'll notice he will get a free ice cream. But he'll get a 20 percent ice cream. So what are they trying to do? They're going to send you guys a lot of business. That's right. And send a lot of more purchase and more profit that they get. Does that make sense? Sierra haven't even able to do that. So I believe today, Fred Meyer would have had the same challenge at their face. And then I think they would have been able to avoid some of those challenges. We can say, thank you for your business. Here's a 20 percent off coupon. 60 percent off of everything, off of milk, which is what they weren't doing. So be mindful. Be careful. We'll leverage CRM strategically. Now, to be able to understand this and understand the profitability, there is a little bit of math involved. And there's something called the lifetime value of a consumer. How did you know that would work? Lifetime value. Now, if you go into literature, if you want to really understand how to leverage lifetime value, you will be able to see this beautiful equation. Now, look at this. You're like, finally, mark this. This is great. Okay. Now, this is great. But this is not what I want you to learn. But know that this is there. Okay. I'm going to simplify it a little bit. So you can sexually understand how to work it. And you'll at least be able to be danger enough to put together back at the end of the loop. One in time. Okay. I'm going to introduce you to the simplified test for a lifetime value expression. Okay. This is great. All we're doing here, you look at this and this. They're about the same. But I want you to notice all the teams. See the team. Now, what we're doing is we're going to make the lifetime value, and equation really looks at how long, how many years, how long that experience with a consumer might be. Simplify just annualize everything. Okay. You just assume that's an annual perspective and that's it. Just to give you a ballpark test. That makes sense. So, here's what I like to do. Like everybody take a minute. And I'd like you to write down this equation. Okay. Write it down so that I can change the slide and you'll know what the equation still is. Now, as you write this down, I'm going to explain it a little bit. Do you remember when I talked about CRM? What were the three key buckets for CRM? Do you remember? All right. I'm going to write it in the name. I'm going to write it in the name. Good. There's one about acquisition of consumers. So, choir. And then there's retained. And both of those are going to be a fuel profitability. Okay. Everybody got that? Now, what we do in lifetime value of the equation is we try to account for both of these areas. We also try to understand how many people have re-earned from the product that they're buying. So, when we're trying to understand the value of the consumer, we want to understand the profitability. This M right here stands for the profitability of the products that they're buying. M stands for market. And the profits. Margin, profit, and so on. So, that's the first element. We want to understand, after we pay our bills, what are these folks actually worth to us from a product perspective? And if they buy more, that M's going to go up. If they buy less, that M's going to go down. The next thing we're going to do is now we're going to think about this. There are also costs associated with the consumer beyond product. Right? There's a margin we make on a product, but that doesn't tell me how much it costs for you to come into the business. That doesn't tell me how much it's going to cost you to keep you in the business. So, I'm going to break that out. I'm going to add two additional things in the one I count for. One is this little C. And this little C represents the cost of keeping that consumer in the business. Cost of retention. Okay? That's the little C. So, little C is the cost of retention. In other words, how much money does it cost us to keep us top of mind? So, they don't forget that first experience that they've already had. How can we keep in that consideration set? So, for example, McDonald's. What is the theme song for McDonald's? That is little C advertising right there. That is a retention ad. That is something to keep the products in your minds. There's nobody that's going to McDonald's for the very first time because they just love that jingle. Right? They're going to go to McDonald's to try and maybe a new McFlurry. They might try it because there's something new coming out. But they probably aren't going to go there just because they love that jingle. So, that little C is a cost of retention ad. Now, so we're going to take those cost of retention ad out here. So, that right there, retain the same carol. But we still have to worry about getting them out the door. This is usually more costly. This is the acquisition cost to the consumer. This is getting them into the door and trying our product for the very first time. This is now, hey, introducing the new McFlurry. Come on in and try this. Or this is one, hey, for first time users, come on in. And you'll be able to go out there and try this new experience for a little bit less than what Adam or Abram is going to be spending. Okay? And so, when you get those first time user deals, acquisition costs. Does that make sense? Okay. So, you've got the money we're making for our product. That's the margin we're making. So, we're going to take another cost of retention to the product. We're going to take out the cost of retaining consumers. We're going to take out the acquisition costs. Right? Now, on the bottom here, now what we're going to do is we're going to include a couple things. So, you're going to go one minus r. r stands for the retention rate. Of all the consumers you bring in, not everyone's going to come back. You're going to get a first time user, that's it. But there will be some who will. What percentage do? And that's what you put into this. What percentage of the consumers you get are going to be coming back more than that. Okay? This I helps us a little bit with time-value money. This is just cost of capital discount. That's it. This is going to be given by your organization. This is going to be based off of what your kind of rule of thumb for cost of capital is going to be when you're there. So, this I is going to be the discount rate for the first capital cost. Can you give me a second? Well, like for example, the company, one of the companies that I worked with, their discount rate that they used was 10%. I'm just going to make you up. Another one might be 11, which one? I don't know. The finance folks, if any of you worked with different discount rates that you use from the subject perspective. I haven't actually worked with that, but a few of the companies that I've researched, like two to three, or 98, 99. So, got it. Okay. But from a discount rate perspective, you've seen how they varied from corporation to corporation. Hopefully with as Hitchcock, I'm going to listen. It's not always the same. So, you as a corporation, you can do this at this and you may be able to evaluate that part. Okay, so that makes sense, everybody? Okay, now that's one thing to look at it. It's another thing to do. Let's do it. Okay, so let's put a little scenario together and give you a little practice. Okay, so I'm going to pay the office. Who's the gentleman right up here? The white shirt. The white shirt. If you know the office, he likes to wear mustard colored clothing. So, because of that, we're going to create a new product called the white mustard colored shirts and the company is going to be calling them a clothing. All right, here we got it. So, here's what I want you to do. I want you to use that, utilize that equation that I gave you. And I want you to figure out the simplified lifetime value that you can superpore it twice, based off of these statistics. I was number sure, so a buy every year is six. Product cost, the price, and average price, is $50. Okay, average variable cost, for sure, is 20. The short rate is 60. Discount rate is 10. Cost of retaining 10. 50% discount on the short of your customer. Now, one thing I want to make sure that you understand. On CLV, this is something that's debated between corporations. This acquisition cost, literature generally takes this from a revenue perspective. Okay, not as a profitability perspective. I've seen companies do both just know that that's something that's debated. Okay, in this class, we're going to do what literature teaches, which is based off the revenue. Okay, is that fair? Okay, so, with that, let's go ahead and play, and let's see if you can find out the cost of a Dwight. Team up, twos and threes. Let's see if you can figure it out. Mark, say go. Okay. Average number, shirt. Average price. Okay, so the first shirt would cost 25 million. I guess all of that. And then actually, that's $5. I'm going to make $30,000. I'm going to make $20,000. Drawing $20,000. We need a profitable revenue, a profit for particularly. We're 30 times. We have very few. We have very few. Showtime. Oh. I'm just going to be 30 times. I don't see a lot of views on Jack. And then on the bottom, it's going to be the one of five. If you have a grandson, He can put a friend out unless it is an asshole. Is he mean is he to get the cost? $27 BC our underwear kid. Good, tough. How good is your underwear kid? == Mega box. I have any comments from.... Yes, we had a compared rating on that. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Open the specifications of our brains. One form in person or another. One form in person, and that's the Earth's Since then. And here is around the earth that it's... and here is around the Earth's Since then. And here is around the Earth's Because it's the results. And here is around the world'serschmitt. And here is around the planet that makes it happen again. And here is about the Earth's But there's space reaches Earth. And円 is around the Earth'sClot, which like CO2Y. S fantastical, sweety back, BOS, what sort of you started again, I'm not sure if it's right. Oh So let's go through this. Okay, so remember on the simple of i version these are just assuming an annual calculation. Right? If you want to really understand the lifetime value you have to get the time etc. So there's a good back in the envelope. So what is the economy clothing CLB for Dwight? How many of you have a good number? I think. Anybody want to throw it out? Any brave souls? Go for it. I got 232-14 232-14? Okay, very interesting. How many of you got 232-14? I don't know. Okay. Who's another one? Probably wrong. 237-86 Okay. Others? I have 217. I have 217. Oh, we're good. If the numbers are beyond you. I think you might be wrong if that's wrong. Okay, let's go through it. Alright, so first up, let's enter the margin. Okay, you take a $50 shirt, we take out the bills, we have to pay 20. That gives us so much. 30 times. 6 is 1.8. Alright, so that's where we get our margin. Next thing, retention cost. This was given to us. $10. Next thing, we throw in as a retention rate. What is retention rate? What's the difference between churn and retention? What is it? Churn is when they basically don't get back. That's right. And what do we want? When they do come back. So, just take, if you're losing 60%, what do you keep you? 40%. Okay, so the retention of that would be 40%. That makes sense? How many of you got caught there? Okay, couple. Okay, now let's keep going. Just get out of rate. Hope nobody got caught there. That's pretty straightforward. Acquisition cost. Now again, this is where I talk about this more of the revenue. This one looks to be debated. But I think it's just fine reasons. We're looking at the revenue perspective. It's a $50 shirt. We're giving them a 50% discount thus giving us a $25 revenue acquisition. Makes sense? Now we can do that. What is the equation? 21786. Okay, so well done. Let's go down. Okay, if you didn't get to the 21786, how many of you see where the mistake was made? Okay, questions on it. Is churn rate common phrase? Yeah. Churn, you'll hear it's just like you lose your churn. Yeah. So my mistake is counterfactoring in the discount of the first shirt into the margin. But we don't want it. I'm assuming we don't want to double count what's in fact green. Well, I think that's one that debate is. And that's why they look at it from a revenue perspective. Versus the profitability perspective on it. Okay, others? All right. You think you can feel, go ahead. I'm going to say the acquisition cost is like that. Well, it is the first shirt that's a $25. But they're cost of getting the shirt $20. Then that acquisition cost is I should $5. That's the debate that number 20 is. Okay, do you write? So that's the revenue version of profitability. And that's what I see debated all the time. I think that's probably the reasons. But this is what now. This is the standard. This is what they do for it. All right. So for this class, it's sort of the standard. And you can debate that. Is that fair? Okay. If I gave you something on a quiz, how many kundations? Okay, good. Now. Okay. Now. Let's talk about why this is working. Why doesn't one understand this? What power does this give you now? Do you understand this? Jared? Thought? I mean, my thoughts are basically just that you understand like how much you should be investing in your customers. So we saw that graph before. Yeah. So we know like, okay, this is after a certain point, it's not worth it to us anymore. So. I have to go after these. I spent my underattention that's great. So think about what we talked about last time. Let's talk best by. If the average best by consumer was only worth 217, how careful do we need to be on what we give back to them? For the life considering their lifetime. Would a hundred dollar coupon potentially be okay? You bet. Would a three hundred dollar coupon be okay? Probably not. In fact, Jeff Bezos, this was the basic math that he used as he built Amazon. He understood that the lifetime value, average lifetime value, was consumer was and told our marketing folks, hey, your budget just don't oversell this. And over time after they did the mention of the e-mail problem. So how would you like, for example, the COVID coupon factor in this equation? Where is that? Why is it the acquisition cost? Like it's continuously growing? Great question. So this one more than likely, those coupons that you have, if you have a coupon, over it, pro-pursed. Are you a new consumer or a current consumer? Correct. So what type of cost would those promotions be? Retention. A little tension. Every little. Yeah. Also, once you understand this equation, now what power does this give you if you're trying to build a business? What if you want to increase the lifetime value of your consumer? What can you now play with? You can play with almost any of these where you can increase margin, decrease retention cost, increase retention rate, or increase acquisition costs. That's right. And now we're talking strategic options. If we want to drive our profitability, if we want to be able to play with the lifetime value of consumers, we now have choices of what we can do to be able to do so. And we just have to figure out what the right thing is. Again, marketing is not just our two crafts. Marketing is just business. And we've got to understand these levers that we can potentially utilize to do the right thing for the business love term. So how is this affected then by a monopoly power company? Are you mentioning Amazon? Yeah. And in fact, technically as they've gotten better at this, the lifetime value of consumers does not significantly significantly. But, if you read it, we make it offer a pre-renewed discount for a team, a customer, or at the same time their model will retention out because of their market power is approaching what? Yeah. And so this is the one thing that this is where, holistically, you're like, well what happens in business is you can really segment this down in different groups. So let's say you've got a new group that you want to bring in, a new target that you want to bring to build this new side of the business. Now, all of a sudden you can actually start doing CLBs for different types of segments. Does that make sense? And so, yes, you're right. But also you can still leverage this tool in more of my new ways to still get that impact. So still a bit powerful. I hope this is something you can play with. If you come across a question that says, hey, I'm going to be able to go and buy some online advertisement. You're going to cost us two grand and on average, this online advertisement deals about 10 million dollars. Who's you doing? You know? Why? Okay, so explain. How did you get the profitability? How do you know that this is more profitable over the 2007? How are you getting that? So, it's a bit of a... Yeah, just multiplying like the one customer that you made this like that. Okay, so I'm going to get 10 times two 17s how much? $2,070. $2,070, right? So, is this profitable? Yes. The event is explained. Well, if you allocate the $2,000, I'll go ahead and get this one from the event. So, you could go out. There are other opportunity costs here versus other investments. I think it's fair. But, just in whole dollars, this is profitable. Yeah. If you look at it in the back, you... Yes, this might... This is something you could do. Is it the best return in the album? We'll see. Okay. Then we'll have to look at all the other options in front of us and do the right thing for business. So, this is where it becomes pretty powerful. So, as we go out there and we try to build stronger loyalty, all we're trying to do is build lifetime value at the consumer. I think in the last class we talked about how many of you actually are on loyalty programs of some sort? Have you seen those loyalty programs increasing over time? More and more people doing this? What are they trying to do? Retain. It's all about lifetime value. Get you to buy more, more frequently, more often, more at a shot, all those different things. And all those things just increase the lifetime value of you as a consumer. That's what we're doing. We're playing that. And so, if we want to make sure that we delight and increase the retention rate, we're going to do programs and we're going to introduce things that are going to help us delight you. I wonder if you're probably going to sit over the liver. And so, you're going to be able to play with a lot of different things. There might be, you know, reward points that are out there. Think about the airlines and all the reward systems they have. Credit cards and hotels and, I mean, almost everything. I think I walked around with my cafe real card for decades. I'm still waiting. But those are all things to be able to entice people to come more often to remember us. You all know this? I'll turn this up a little bit. Or I'm going to back it up a little bit. So, when you entice, usually in the app, and you're trying to put together a program, and you're trying to figure out what can I offer to consumers and what types of people that can make sure you offer something of value. Here is Dwight's setup. I'm going to send it to the room, please. This is a shrewd block. When you have done something good, you will receive one thousand shrewd blocks, equals an extra five minutes per lunch. What is the cash value of a shrewd block? X-Line question, Pam, one hundredth of a cent. So, ten thousand of your dollars is worth one wheel dollars. Just kidding. Okay, so don't offer things just to offer things. Make sure that it's not done. Okay? Make sure you're not offering shrewd blocks. Now, the goal is to make sure that we can elevate engagement. So, we get loyalty programs and frequency. We do this in almost everything. And the tools and the things that are available to our phones and online shopping, all the other things. This is always increasing and it's always improving. I love baseball, but living here in Utah, I don't go to a lot of major league games, but I'll tell you, the fact that I went to San Diego and caught a pod of games probably about a decade ago, and gave them permission to market to me, they never say anything to me during the years until I cross into California. And then my phone goes off. And I'm getting ad after ad and reminder after reminder, my Facebook goes crazy. It's geo-fencing tools that they have there to remind me, hey, don't forget us. This could be an amazing part of your vacation. Come on in. It's all about retention. And you have corporations like Adobe that are there specifically on a B2B perspective, that help major league baseball or other organizations improve the experience for their clients, so that people will want to stay engaged, so that people will want to spend a little bit more money. It's all about the lifetime value of the consumers. So as a marketer, we care about this. As business people, we care about this. And so let's figure out the tools that will help us enhance this as much as we can. The goal is to make people believe that we want to make sure we've nourished long-term emotional events. Which is like a relationship. For those of you that have been married, when you go and you have that special day, it's great to be able to promise someone and say, you know what, this is what I'm committing. And you try to meet that commitment. Now, do as everyone keep that commitment. No, unfortunately. And sometimes, in the same thing in business, when you have that first interaction, you create an expectation. And you hope that you can keep that commitment going forward. But do we always delight in home? Even healthy marriages, we don't always delight sometimes. It happens. But don't have those types of relationships where you just kind of forget all the commitment to your business. And business, we sometimes do this. Okay, don't do that. That's not good. But instead, go out there. Remember, they're long-term. And with the appropriate consumers, again, businesses isn't doing everything. The goal of business is not to be with every single customer that's out there. But don't find the ones that really do evolve with you. And nurture that relationship and try to enhance it more. If you do that, you can have a really nice, long-term writing business. But you have to evolve with your decisions. The things that you were concerned about probably 15 years ago, is very different from what you're concerned about today. We evolve. And obviously, that's easy when you're a kid versus now when you're a goal. But even 15 years ago, what I'm thinking about now and evaluating now, versus what I value, then, there's some evolution, there's some changes here. So be thoughtful about that. All right, so today, today, what we're going to do, is we're going to talk about important choices that we've made to drive that bound. The goal of business, the business, the market term, and improve our policy, the wider share of the customer's team, to solve their problems. So here's what I wanted to do. We're going to do a little exercise with you. I would like you to think about your first day on your first internship. Okay, and we're going to pretend for a second. Let's say that you decided you wanted to go into Borough of the Energy. And so you're over a specific product for a specific brand. And let's say you go into the work and your boss welcomes you and said, Hey, welcome to the business. Zach here, I've got this great folder here. Everything you want to know about the business is right here. Here's your first assignment. You've got 24 hours. I'd like you to merge yourself into this data. I'd like you to go and talk with people on our team. And I want you to get to know this business. And in 24 hours, I'd like you to come back and give me a one-pageer on the health of our business. All right, you're an intern. You're coming with new eyes. You're going to see things that maybe I don't. So give me a good one-pageer on the health of this business. All right, so that's your first assignment. Here's what I'd like you to do. I want you to team up, 2s and 3s. I want you to write down what is the information you're going to collect? What is going to help? What are the seniors? What do we want to make sure that we can cover and look at you? I really hear them understand how healthy we are as a client. Okay, go ahead and take a couple minutes. Mark said go. I feel like you're talking to me as an intern. What's the problem? I'm not going to be a spy. You're not going to talk to me. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm not going to talk to you. I'm also like... What do you guys want to do? Something to do? Where do you find this thing. What is going on? What isn't the business? I was like the best of the whole world. When you guys are home. They like the biggest things. I worked in fashion. So it's like more of a disrespecty and a bullying. And so, you know, to gauge whether you're doing good or bad. But I was even like, I was like, I was like, it's the first time I've done this. Like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like a lot of work. It's like, So I have this, it's a market. Yeah. It's like, it's not hard for you. You know, so she's like, it's like, it's not hard for you. Okay, now we're gonna add a little bit of, new ones to it, right? Let's assume that now you're working for BOWS. And let's say you've got a new product that's the, kind of like they equivalent to an air pot, right? So, those, Lou Tuth's speaker, right? See if that changes you into a discussion a little bit or enhances where you might want to look, okay? Go for it. So this is one of the first parts that's more important than you're doing before. Yeah. It's like, it's a competition. It's like, it's a competition. It's like, it's a competition. It's like, it's a competition. It's like, it is, it's boring, it's like分 of. Yeah, you have a reviewer for their own art. My screen play. Yeah. Is that in the right particular content? Yeah. In the right hands? I mean, I can. Alright, I need my Pinterest. You have it. I need my Pinterest. Alright, Yeah. LAJON I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I'm just a little bit more focused on the way I do it. I think this is our final round. I think this is our final round. I think this is our final round. I think this is our final round. I think this is our final round. All right, let's go. Great turn. You got 24 hours of turn around. This is your slowest time in the position of the LV business. Where you start, what are your things that you're going to look for? Just open it up. Please go closer. We categorize it under a financial and organizational. Let's go to the finance. What type of finances are you considering? What do you want to look at? Current state. So, PL or... Good, so we're going to look at just overall margins. Yes. Revenues that we bring in. You look at it in a snapshot and you look at it over time. I want to know what's current, but mostly over time. I want to know trends and how, what direction they've been going for. Okay, good. Current and trends. Good, love that. It's great place to start. What else? What we're doing? We talked about just looking at the stock price as well. Let's see how it has to be, how it has to be. How are you going to start looking at this? Good, stock price. It's going to be important. Love that. Do you think that Wall Street's going to care about that? Obviously, we'll put our prediction in the turn. Good. Is there a question? Are we having consumers here? Yeah. So, yeah, so we're going to look at consumer retention. What do you hear about that? Just that too, Steve. Well, specifically for these headphones, I'd be curious to know how much, what's the turn rate, how many people actually enjoy and come back? He's in the love group. I have them. I have Odeera. Actually, I'm going to use them because I like both of them. They're engineers. Oh, yeah, I would do that. They're engineers. Thanks, a little retention here. You're going to look at it. What else? We're talking about how we doing the work and compare with competitors. So, what are you going to compare versus competitors? Is that really important? What are you going to look at? Well, I think we should look at what part they have and what our technologies are. Like, what are we compared with them? Are we talking right all of them as well? So, you're going to look at the competitor offerings? Yeah. What they have? Good. There's a term out there called share. What is share? What's share? It's your competitor. It's like the percentage of the market that you own versus your competitor. It's good. So, all the business out there, what's yours? Relative to Zappies. And so, when you talk about competitors offerings, are they able to look at it from a share perspective, as well? Yeah. Now, there's a couple of times, there's two main types of share that we usually look at from where evaluating just kind of top line information. Or the two times of share that we might want to look at here. Dollar share and unit share? Good. That's it. So, share, you can look at it from a dollar perspective. Dollar share. In other words, if the category is worth a billion dollars, what percent is ours? Okay. Units is the other kind. Or a volume share. You don't want to smile. So, units or volume share. Now, we look at all the earphones that are sold, what percent are ours? So, if you've got bows and it's higher price than the AirPods, we think they're really going to be focused on it. They're probably dollar. They're going to be each and both. But dollars, whether you really look at it. Okay. When I was on the, when I was a con-Abra, I saw a bank with meals, food for dollar. I was all about volume share. When I was on the recalitors and I was charging 350 for a meal, I was all about dollar share. That's what I would tap from my... That's a good question. Is it pretty much units? So, then you can then tell your boss, like, hey, I know we only own 10 percent of the market, but don't worry. In terms of dollars, it's actually... Well, I mean, there's a good reason being both, right? For unit share, what does that tell? What does that tell the world? What do you tell it? People like us. Yeah. They choose us. If I'm on dollars, what does that tell? They like us. And more and more profitable. And that's kind of nice. We're doing more with less. There's seem more value in us than these others. So, first pros and cons. What's another one? Yeah. What's another one? It's another one. It's a distributed relation. Yeah. Good. So, best buy. Yeah. So, let's look at our partner. Check it out. So, let's look at best buy. Another retailer. Why does that matter? Yeah. Do we need that? Yeah. To reach some kind of cost of your company. Good. What's going on? Yeah. We're getting their operation means by changing. In terms of like the fine demand. Good. Yeah. I mean, like, you can turn it into a role with, like, okay. I don't know how much of this we're meeting back in America. We're assuming it was worth... We're talking about... Yeah. Like, how is it going to affect you? So, how efficient are we? Okay. Those are those little things. Are you in supply chain? I was. I'm doing the... I thought you could get it. How happy will they still be? I thought that. Happy. You would be thrilled, actually. We should think about the word to exceed it. Yeah. You should be sharp in that. We're good. All right. What other? Yes. I would like to know who our customers are, our segments. To know, like, who are we selling to? Who is that? Because they already talked about the competitors, like, but who's buying us over them? And how much? Good. So, we're talking about this consumer retained. Who are they? Then you can also ask where's the top? Yeah. And then also like sentiment. Like, I would like to get what's the overall, yeah, brand perception out there. Good. Let's end Vs. No. We just understand what people are saying, but how they feel about overall. Thanks. I don't think they like to put their ROI target is because they're probably playing the launch of the burden of this in my career. And so, how far along that horizon they are, the region is for the next level. Very good. So we could look and say, what's their expectation? Are we getting it in that way? It's better understand how it's business. So, how blood to look at? Do you want to market channels within this thing? And what are the kind of costs associated with those channels? And then, once we got broad from influencers to maybe suitable athletes. Good. So, when it comes to connecting with these consumers, you know, what are they doing? What are they doing when it comes to the media fit? Where they're buying? And then how well will they be performing there? Yeah, I got like, what, you know, what kind of expectations do you get that from TNIA? Good. All those different ROI. Good, no? I don't want to look at some of the data about the customer lifetime value. Like, overall, do we have high customer lifetime value? Do we have very variable? Is it low? Is it dropping year over year? Is it using year over year? I don't know. We'll get some of those trends. Well, that, others. I'll piggyback not that. I'd be curious to know for a company like, if those like headphones are probably a great, like, kind of, a favorite. Like, to, to, to, welcome them into the Bose family, to that, because that may affect customer lifetime value. You can, if somebody buys headphones later, buy like a car stereo system or buy some of their favorite ticket items. Yeah, now, yeah, now all of a sudden, like, maybe we're not actually going to make money on this exact headphone, because if we can get them into door, we're going to make money on them, or from them, the future. So product rolls, and how that is moving to fuel. Yeah, let's go. I thought about later, cannibalization, but they have different. Is that important, if you consider? No, I'm not right. Go for it. Go for it. Look at that. I want to say mine and for sure they have a research development. Is that important? Yeah. Can you have a really healthy business, but really be in a precarious position? A little future? Yeah. Yeah. So I, I love that. Boy, I think that's really, really important. So understand what your view of the patient's on the looks like. That might help me understand how healthy we are too. You think that's a version of how? I also just want to hear what your test can do. What happened to your computer? Okay, that's a good question. Okay, I love that. I love that. Okay, look. Just kind of jumping off of that. We talked about employee retention with slash trend. Also employee life time value. Like do people stay here for a long time and get really good at marketing our staff or selling it? Yeah, we got spare, right? And once again, now Jeff is going to be thrilled we have to be talking about this. Because it matters. And it does have an impact on the health of the business. More than he was, their competitors and the product. Good. So when it comes to us versus this competitor here, you know, do we have, how is the competitive position? Are we really unique? Or are they really unique? And how does that impact us? Okay, pretty good overview. If you were able to go and put this together 24 hours, how many of you are going to go in your body? Okay, now next question. How many of you would have been able to develop this list by yourself? Some of you may be, how many of you like, no, I didn't think of many, many, couple of other things. Okay, this is the power of working on teams. This is why we do things in teams. This is what we teach each other. This is a really, really good thing. As we understand the health of the business, you can get against an OSU. As we understand the health of the business now, I would say when I'm seeking first and understand, you've learned a little bit, and now you can start making more and more better choices. And so what I like to transition now is to strategy. Now when you think of strategy, what is strategy? So on the gets more future based, and I know what success looks like. Here's the path and how we're going to get there. Yeah, you've got a really nice concise definition. What's another breath? How do you get and maintain a competitive advantage? Okay, good. So now, if we understand what success looks like, how can we create a plan that gives us the best chance of winning? That can be strange. Maybe we want to add to that. That's good too. It's a nice kind of pivot on narrow right there. Others, please. How do we calculate some of our core coffee? Good. How can we leverage what we do well to win? Thanks, strategy. Could be a decision. Okay, can't be for sure. Yeah, it is understanding data. Will that name less to be able to make better choices? I better strap. Yeah, for sure. Other, Joseph, this makes me think it likes God to do your requires other players like how we respond to the news that other players in the industry are making. Okay, so you think you more hold this decley? Good. So I was going to say, just looking at a lot of resources to be had. And noticing work. You know, because it always needs to be scarcity. And so we're going to put those resources where the best can turn into high-sliver. Excellent. So again, kind of what was playing on this idea of what competitive advantage is doing that. Are we really understanding ourselves well enough that we can know what we can utilize? And are we doing it the smartest way? It's one thing you know what success looks like. It's another thing you know how to get there. It's another thing you know what the best. Okay, we love that. I actually paid risk game a lot on my phone. And I think it's Oba's strategy. And I think I got better at every time. I play a lot of games. I always too much time on that. So I realized that I like, you know, because I like to play with like 500 people. I just play with two or three people. Because I think more people that you walk and see. I think it just, you learn so much about human behavior by playing that game. And I want to learn that like, if you want to be successful, but when you at the end you have to play the hat. You have to think how they think. You never attack anybody. You always beat the someone that is very friendly. And people attack themselves first. Always be friendly with everybody. Even then attack you. You still be their friend. Even maybe wait the time is right. You had time, you had the time. Right? The time you had the power to overcome them. Then that's when you attack them. I mean before that you used to be their friends and be friends. That's why I learned, you know. How many of you just learned a lot right there? No, I think that's great. So is strategy also anticipating what reactions might happen? Yeah. I'm going to move on just real quick. In the reading, the added chance to read before coming class today. It gave us some new strategic frameworks to consider. Before we get into the frameworks, and if we get into the frameworks because of time today. I'm curious why were they looking for this frameworks? What are the shortfalls? What are the challenges that marketing leaders, business leaders, are facing right now when it comes to the strategic frameworks and the strategic challenges are facing? What were some of the key things? How and what did they say? No clear methodology for transforming the target company. Good. So there's no magic bullet. There's no clear way. At least the parallel wearer. Yeah, I love that. Thank you. What else? Really, you get distracted on certain things. And there's just certain things that you have to do now. And that's what I really think big picture. Good. How can we fix these tactical challenges that we have there? Sometimes within a certain division, but still keep the big picture in mind. Really tough to do sometimes. Others. I'd like to, close to the beginning, said that they kind of viewed it as like a trend. They didn't really view it as a poor transformation. They kind of viewed it as a transition into OEU, this new tool to do the same thing that we were doing. But they could have been more strategic and seen new value with the new environment. Yeah, it's like they, I love that too. They talked about, look, we find a problem. We're going to go buy some technology to solve that problem. But are they really solving the root cause of that problem? So they're looking at holistically and changing their thinking versus just, finding the technology to fix that problem. I agree. I just love that they framed everything in terms of value. If they had like exchange value, experience value, engagement value, customer value, corporation value, yeah. In terms of value, which I think with your strategy, like it's important that as a company, you are creating value. Ultimately, that's all companies. That is correct. So I think framing that and knowing that all of your actions need to be value placed. I think that kind of answers your question. I heard they were like, what, how do you know the health of the company? It's like, well, where are we creating value? I love that. I think that's correct. And to force yourself to look at a framework that says, we can't just look at it. Yeah, this is what we do. We're working extra-wise. But we can't just look there. Because if we do that, we ignore all the things that we're bringing in from our corporation. And now that what happens next to your point? We got to think about holistic ways of looking at strategy. I'll tell you, I spent the whole summer one year looking at marketing strategic frameworks. There's a gazillion of them. This framework that they show, I read it, I was like, there's a lot of value there. I like this. But more importantly, for today's discussion, I want to tackle, I wanted to introduce some new frameworks to you. But I think what tackle build initial challenges that they discussed. Looking at things, for listening, they change even thinking versus fixing a specific problem. They're thinking about what happens next. That's what I want to go to some of the other sessions. So that's what we're going to do. So I'm going to introduce a couple different frameworks for you. I'm referring to these are the frameworks I told you I like Batman. These are utility belt frameworks. Batman is great because if he ever gets in a jam or a problem, he's pulled out something new because the utility belt is solid. I look at frameworks a lot like this. These frameworks are going to help you think through things in new system-ad way. They may not solve the problem perfectly, but they'll at least help you look at them with new eyes. And hope we'll be able to simplify things along the way. So today, we're going to be hitting one of the most important frameworks that I want to teach you over the entire semester. It's called Harvard Business Framework. Have you ever heard of the four P's? Have you ever heard of the four C's? If any of you have taken my class in undergrad, you better remember. If you haven't, it's okay. We're going to show you that these are actually tied together. How many of you know what STP's stand for? Okay, a couple of them. That's good. We then, we'll let you just couple other strategic frameworks. McKinsey 7S, really nice framework to make sure that you really throw in a value of certain elements of your business. I'm sure a lot of you have heard of Porter's fight forces, great competitive and channeled model perspective. You'll learn about something called the BCG growth matrix. Just understand how you can organize a portfolio a little bit more effectively. And then of course, everybody's favorite model, SWOT. How many of you have swat before? All right, most of you. How many of you have quickly taken that SWOT and put it in the appendix and never looked at it again? Most of you. We're going to talk to you about how you actually use SWOT and use a strategic and win to use it. So we'll go through this. So the first model I want you to get is the Harvard Business Framework. The Harvard Business Framework is all about value. You can talk about this. Let's see if it goes to it. The first principle that they teach is before you make strategy. Can I simplify strategy just a little bit from my perspective? In my mind, strategy is all about board thinking choices. Forward thinking choices. What is the difference between a strategy and a tactic? Page, you say action. Okay, it could be time. Time, maybe. The tactic plays into your global strategy. It's like a big picture of tactics to just switch. Okay, I like that. Which would mean sometimes for short term or for small term. Is that kind of where you're going with time? Yeah, how strategy is the conversion? Good. So it's the how behind the choice. So here's what I look at. So let's say that, let's say I skipped lunch and now I'm really hungry. If I wanted to go eat dinner, I have some strategic options in front of me. After this class. What could I do? So we... I could go eat. Where could I go? I could go here. It saves some time with the blue line. There's pros and cons for that. Where else could I do? What else could I do? I could go walk over to the will. There's pros and cons with that. What else could I do? Standing machines. I could go to the dining machines, pros and cons. Jordan. Left over at home? I could go home and grab some things. I could have leftovers or I could make something new. I could do door dash. A lot of different strategic options, some choices that I can make. All will help me achieve my goal of building my stomach. Okay? They're choices. I just have to pick which strategies can help me best create the most value for me. Now let's say that I choose to go home and eat. And let's say I choose that I'm going to make something new. So I could grab, I go to my... I go to our pantry and I grab craft blue box, craft packing machines. Right? Now, I open up that craft blue box and on the back, there's a recipe to how to make this product. In my mind, that's the tactics. Your choices with how you're going to fill your stomach, you've made a choice now, you just select your strategy, now the tactics are how do you execute that strategy. Does that make sense? In a simplified way, that's the way I look at it. You hear people in industry say that person is not very strategic. They get caught in the weeds. They heard that. What are they saying? They're not looking at the bigger picture. They get stuck in the tactical execution. Okay? We want to make sure you're thinking about the big picture. Harvard Business Framework wants to make sure you start with the big picture. And they take something that President Nelson teaches us. Our profit, information, yields, revelations and inspiration. The more we understand, hopefully the better choices will make it. And that's where the Harvard Business Framework starts. It's all about understanding. Come and talk about seeking first to understand before you start making a decision. We hear this old phrase, it's ready aim fire. It's not fire ready aim. So let's understand, let's ready ourselves. Let's aim and then we'll shoot. Does that make sense? Okay. In order for us to understand, I want you to learn this very simple phrase. Whenever you have a business question, where do you always, always start? Lately. See if you remember. Very good. I want everybody to repeat that. Whenever you have a business question, where do you always always start? Or C. Or C. Okay. This is a framework to help you seek for a self-understand. It's just a really simple framework that's actually really natural. What happens pretty intuitively, we still almost realize. What we do is, before we make a strategy, we need to understand internally ourselves. And so we're going to understand C company. We're talking financials here. We're talking HR here. We're taking operations here. We're talking the financials here. All the things we learn here at Business School. Internally, how are we performing? Okay. What strategic competitive might we have? What skills do we have that are better than other people? Seek first to understand. What does our portfolio look like? What do consumers say about us? If it's about us, we want to know. C company. Got that? Next one, consumers. Now we're talking about who we want to do business with. We need to understand all the different folks what they care about. I don't care if it's business. Business. I don't care if it's business, business, business, business, consumer. We need to understand what our potential clients value. We need to understand what they care about. We need to understand what jobs they're hiring as for. Really understand them. What motivates them? What do they think about? What do they worry about? And what do we understand? Consumers. The better we've been able to like them long-term. The next thing we understand is we need to look at our competition. We need to identify who are they. We need to understand what they're good at. We talked a little bit about that on the board. What do they bring to the table that we can? How's their portfolio relative to ours? Do you understand what they do? Intuitively. If let's say you take price, what are they doing response? Where do they go to strategies if you do something? Can you anticipate it? Are you thinking about what they're going to be doing next? Are you being nice to them right now? And then when you know the tech, right? Those are the things that we might do. The next one is we need to understand what's channel. What does that be? How I get into the customer good. Channel means these are the external players that help us do business. They can be suppliers and they can be providers. They can help us sell our products out in the marketplace. At the end of the day, business, all these things have to be done. If it's whether or not we hire someone to help us do those things. And if we are partners, do we understand what they value? Do we understand what their skillsets are? Do we understand what their deficiencies are? Do we understand them well enough that we can help them achieve their financial goals? If we do, we might get a really good partner for them. If not, they may not want to do business with us very long. Do you understand what they value? So if I segment this and always, always, always stink through four C's, this is a nice, succinct framework that helps me understand the landscape. And you're sometimes people in strategy with a landscape assessment. They're walking through the four C's. Any interview question, an idea to case interview question, I walk through my four C's to this deck. I'm thinking about an idea to be an even student product. What would you do? Pay the Zoom company, channel, I got it. I'll give you all those things to show that I'm thinking about big picture. If you understand big picture, hopefully, you'll be able to add more value. Okay? So this is what we do now from here. And once we see first-end understand, now we need to start creating value. And we do that by going to our consumers, our customers. We go to who we're doing business with. I remember that. Who? It was first, one strategy. Who we're going for is first. So I'm going to figure out who I could do business with. Somebody could call second-station. I'm going to go and figure out who I shouldn't do business with because not all consumers create an equal, profitably, strategically. And then I'm going to figure out what I'm going to say to them, position, because I understand what they're care about. So I'm going to figure out the landscape. And then I'm going to figure out who I'm doing business with. And then what they value and what we want to stand for in their concern, in their minds. And then I get to the how. Who? What? How? So I get to the who, second-end company, the what? What? What we want to stand for and then the how? And this is where you start hearing about something called the four P's. This is where you get a little bit of artifacts. Okay? If I decide that I want to be a low-cost provider for my product, that's going to impact my position. Product influences the position in the consumer's mind. If I decide that I'm going to sell it over at Nordstrom versus Dollar General, that might impact the position in my mind in the consumer's mind. If I charge a million dollars for a product, person $100,000 for a product, that might impact the position in their mind. If I tell consumers certain things, that will obviously help with the position. So notice, who builds off of consumer? What builds off of segmenting and turning to? And then how is all about reinforcing that position that you've decided to stand for in the minds of consumers? Who? What? How? You'll notice that prices where you actually get your grid. That's where you capture the value you've been earning over time. Then, once you get your plans laid out, now you just have to go and execute. And now we need to do something called C-R-FM. We've got to acquire them, we've got to retain them, and hopefully through all of our efforts, we'll be more profitable. Folks, whenever you have a business question, where do you always always start? Forsees always. Think about that, get that down. Please, memorize this. We're going to be using this all semester long. In fact, if you look at the syllabus, it's organized through the Harvard Business Framework. So please, go in, have some fun, memorize this, get it down, and it'll be easier and easier for you to go to the rest of the semester. Great discussion today. We'll see you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I'm so excited about this. Yeah, yeah. You're like, hold it in."
