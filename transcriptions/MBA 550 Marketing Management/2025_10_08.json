  "text": "So make your study like a little easier. I'll do a kind of slide some. And make sure that my face comes from back. So you don't have to do this. Now, that doesn't mean you don't have to know where you're reading. There are readings I like to do. The way that I do exams, I'm not kind of a stumped that's up in type of question. Oh, we're in the line up. One, no graphics, seems arbitrary. So if you look at reading, if you see some of the key takeaways, they should know that. I will must please you at all on impacts from a case. So I'm not going to ask you about a wall, through a wall or anything like that. I'll ask you about key takeaways. Instead of the key things that we discussed in class, that I won't be asking you what percentage of people have bank accounts. I'm not going to do that. OK? Is that helpful a little bit? Yeah, please. I don't know if you know any testing center. I should bring the phone to the table. But I'm secure. Yeah. It'll be on the table. So it'll be on the table. Scan Tron. It'll be on the table. Yeah. And shape. And shape. And shape. Right before you go. It's really right before you go. Yeah. Don't go. You get 30 set of razor and you go to the bathroom. And it's like water, 30 set of razor, blood everywhere. So much you have to go to the bathroom. I'm not. So it's not hurt. I can't help but see. I'm going to go in and also. I've heard some heart-spin. I've heard that just a couple of minutes. I don't get any of my personal answer. So what it is about stealing. But it's a very good time. It's a great before you go. You can't do it. You can't do it during the devotional. They don't allow anyone to eat dirty. Yeah. Do you really mind full of the testing center of how it's done that they can go? Because they have sometimes even weird things on test because they're just double check if you can get it. Make sure you do yourself an overtime. On average, I think on average, we usually average probably around 15 minutes. So if you're slow-taker, keep yourself an uptime. If you're a fast taker, just know that that's what they have. There's also if you go into the BYU 10 Center website, there's a camera to see how long the line is. You've got the question. That's all they have to know. Hey, is that good? Yeah. Is there time room? No, no time room. Take a tiny. I want to get that up to equation. I just want you to ask for a question. Thank you. Any other questions, Will? I guess you'll send me the clarification. A lot of times, the last day. So technically, the test is open from the 14 to the 16. And the 17th is a late day. Yes, a lot of times, that's the case. So the late day is the last day, or how I feel. Correct. That's so good. So I just be mindful of that. Now, there's been a couple of people who take these answers from me. Park any one to give any thoughts? There. I was there. Like I've never taken a test from Mike Martin. And I was there. Like, OK. I wanted to make sure that you are building a solve competition. OK. It's a quiz. So I want to make sure that when we start doing our real strategy work, that you've done, you've internalized some of the material that we've talked about. Take a tiny little bit of a bastard so that when you start, you're starting with a good foundation. That's the essence. Cool. All right. So be mindful. That's going to be coming out again in the new session Monday 3.30. That's where you're going to target after. They'll probably, the challenge is going to be getting in time after 3.30. But we'll do our best. That's the thing that's going to start. OK. Awesome. All right. All right. Any other answers? We'll be starting. I'm going to give you one. OK. All right. Last time, what do we have to play? A little game. A little game. It's a little game. It's a little game. We're having a good time. A little bit about when is Patrick here? And the hot water is that for a daily experience to be able to let some real world understand. What were some of the key takeaways you got from this experience? What did you learn from this game? Yeah. Let's see. About some of the unwritten rules within categories. Good. Are we mindful of unwritten rules within categories? I love that. That's good. Especially from a real world perspective. That's cool. Other than OK. I just said maybe look a little bit higher than you're on the board. Good. So being a Mee monster, just focusing on repeating the competition you're going to be. May not always be the best draft. Be sure. That's it. That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be in my middle of the strategy. I don't know what that would be. Good. And that's one of the main reasons why I do this game. So please remember, whenever we make a choice, that's why, if I do this, what will happen to my forces? Think about all of this. Because that's going to be critical down the billboard. Any other key insights? Yes. So just like how much power the retailers have over your business? Yeah. It's almost surprising how much they actually do controls. And imagine if we don't have those seeds and we could get about that change and how important they are. What type of a station is? Well, I'm glad that this was something that you could learn from. Again, it wasn't a perfect real world scenario. But there are some insights and there are some things that you can learn. I hope you're making better decisions. Particularly for those of you that are these people working with channels, partners, it's critically understand the power and the need for that. Which leads us to somebody else who's been discussing about the channel. He discussed how our choices, if we go in broadly, it impacts so many different applications. So please be mindful of all the different ways that the channel can use. Also, if you do work with the channel, partner, whether it be supplier or a vendor that's going to actually sell the product for you, whether it be digital or whether it be in brick and mortar stores, doesn't matter. Do you know their language and their culture? Do you understand what they care about? Have you done your research to understand what their KPIs are, what their bonus on them? If you understand those things, you're going to be able to hopefully develop strategies to help them win and you win. And if you can do that, the odds of you getting your strategy accepted can be greatly enhanced. And so we thought about that. Now, as you go in and dive into these areas, as you learn about what a certain vendor cares about, these are all breaking more to think about on the KPIs on a digital. Or what they care, understand the math and to do your homework, prepare. If any of you take grand management after this next semester or this next fall, we'll go into some of the math and I here. Some of the things that we really have to go and understand is you work with these different players. Thank you. Now, one of the other key things that we discussed like before this semester, we talked about to be included on our assist in 40s channel partners. Sometimes we play a little slot or we play a little trick. Remember those two types? Slotting, what I always said. What was the other one? What does this catch me? Three days. Yeah, it's like a recon. It's like, I'm going to give you a sale if you promise to put your product on sale. Okay? If you do it, then you're going to get that discount. Does that make sense? So, we talked about those two deep artists. We talked about slotting. We talked a little bit about trick. Now, for those of you that are going to be working with players, do you actually put your product on sale? They actually use that P of promotion and price. This discussion is going to be really important. Within any math or with any price that you're going to get some price math, when you start working with channel partners, you've got to start looking at the math not from your perspective, but from their perspective. And that's going to help you ensure that your price target is what you want. It's not just what they want to be. So, I'm going to teach you just a little bit about some pricey math, trade-and-math, so it will help you be a little bit more dangerous for your goal for you to get. So, let's say that, I think what one of those products, kind of, I don't know, it's such a situation. I'll take the red and shade. Okay, can't work it. All right, so let's say Jake decides that he is going into the product. Let's say he's a friend and manager for a protein shake. All right, and let's say he goes and wants to go for a good tariff. All right, wants to be able to get shelving in the target successfully. That's so. Next shop. Well, now he wants to be your non-alcohol citizen. So, he's giving a little slotting, he's got on the shelf. But now he wants to be the price point that he wants. Now, historically, I think I told you this earlier, of a pricing perspective, there's different types of prices that we got. By law, Jake needs to make sure that he offers that price, that protein shake, the same for anybody at every different retailer here in the low-48. Now, if you go to why you go to Alaska, if you're transportation fees, that price is good. But, at least in the lower 48, you have to buy a lot of it and charge the same amount. So, buy on charge Costco, a price for a buy-charred Walmart, or pigly-wiggly, or a buyer, or whoever may be, I by law have to give them the same, what we call list price, or gross sales rate. Remember, gross sales, that's the top line. So, it's that grossest top line, gross margin, top line margin, gross sales, top line sales. I have to give a list price, or gross sales rate, or gross sales price. Let's say, for a gay pack of your protein shakes, you charge a 19-greet, that's a good quality, let's see, there it is. All right, now, with that, here's what I'd like you to do. Let's say, to get into Target, you know that Target has a benchmark of margin, say, like, what you like to make, but what they like to make, and they like to make 35% on all protein shakes. Or if I get that? So, if that's the case, let's say that we're in an eight pack case, so I take the 19-31 to do what? To get to the youth. All right, all right, all right. And if I am, okay, so I'm going to take that 19.31, and divide that by 8. Maybe I would have calculated what is that? $2.41. $2.41, thanks, thanks. So, for $2.41 per unit, Target now needs to elevate their price to make sure that they get a 35% margin. Does that make sense? Okay, so I want you to see if you can figure out how to do this. What would be the math? And what would be the on-shelf price for one of those protein shakes at Target? Okay, Mark, say, go, team up, two, and three. See if you can teach each other. Let's see if we can get it down. Go for it. Yeah. What is the math and what is the question? It's such a snack, you know, that you only find a snack. So, there's like a 30-35% margin. So, let's just walk through the chart. Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, Target, I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I'm not sure if I can get a picture of it. I do this one. OK, so we're joy. Can we back up? Can we back up? Yes. How do we do a piano? What's the tough one? What's the tough one? Row sales, minus. Trade, gives me net sales, minus. Okay. Good. 子, please. I'm going to look at the wall marks. If I wanted to figure out my gross margin percentage, you remember the equation? Good, gross margin by the by net sales. Let's just play it with this. Let's say now I'm going to look at the wall marks. Not mine. Wall marks pay not pay me trade. If they sell it for $3.26, $3.26, no trade, that means their net sales will be $3.26. What's going to be their cost of goods? $2.41, so regular price of what we sold it to before. What do I get from my gross margin? What is it? $2.85, good. Now let's check it. $2.85 divided by $3.26, what's the margin? Not it. It is it. $2.26% is not the right price. No, this is why we double check. Let's try it over here. $3.71. Okay, no trade again. $3.71 for my gross margin. $2.41, what do I get now? $3.30, what's $1.30 divided by $3.71. $3.35. $3.40. Okay, now let's walk through it. Let's see if I can give you a solution with this. The key thing is for those of you that gave you the $3.26, that's a really common way to look at it. Because that's what we look at it from our brand side. Let's look at it from the retailer side. That's what we've got our views. So what we do, so what we're going to do is, here's the mess. You go through the slides and we'll be able to remember. First thing I do is I'm going to think that 1931, I'm going to buy a bike. I'm going to do that, I get you $1.41. That's pretty clear, right? For using. Now the next thing I'm going to do is I want to figure out how retailers learn to up their price. They want to have a $35% margin. Here's an equation of what all of you remember. Really important equation. Okay, so the price that on shelf price right here equals the variable costs. In other words, the price will charge in them. That's their cost to good. So the price equals the price that we charge them divided by 1 minus that margin. Okay, now because this is an equation, we can actually see different power goals. We just get two of those variables. We do a lot of work. We've got not on one type of one price. But I've got to find that. Sure. So P equals the price we want to charge on shelf. That's the retail sales price. DC is the variable cost to the retail. In other words, the charge of the price will charge in that. The margin is the target that they're trying to achieve the retail. Does that make sense? So what I do that here is for that. Yeah, two for you. So what I do that now, again, if we're doing this from scratch, I'm going to make sure I get per unit. So there's my two. So I've got that down. Now here's my $241 per unit. Using this equation, I'm trying to figure out what my price will be. So P equals $241 when it costs from them. My, this is the one minus the point 35. Now that works. Okay, and when I do that, that gives me $3.70. Okay. Now, if I, that's going to get done with a retail sales price will be more ununity. Now, does the retailer buy in units or in cases? In cases, so what I'm going to have to do to that number? I'm going to have to multiply that by 8. Or good. Okay. Now, here's the one thing I want to share with you. Please. When you do the math, if you can, on your calculators or on your computers, make sure you don't round. Okay. If you divide and number into something, if you get multiple decimal points, those multiple decimal points can have a huge impact if you're multiplying something by a million cases. So make sure you don't round until everything is done. Does that make sense? Okay. All right. Now, these examples, just for simplicity, because we're going to be back to the end of the world, I can't wait. But when you do this in real world, don't round until you're always in the end. Okay. All right. So now, let's have some fun. Let's have traits of the math. Okay. Let's say the Jake wants to, he's got a competitor that's selling it for $3. How much is he charging? Unchelle? $3.71 is what Targets Charging Prius. But he wants to be more competitive. He wants to get it down to $2.99. And so he's going to offer a promotion. So Targets can entice people to come in. So how do you get, what's the math user? So again, take a big equation. You can get about the different variables in that equation. And let's just fill it out. You can do that. That, that, what's EDL means? EDL means great question. What does that mean? Do we know? EDL is a price range. That's it. EDL is a price range. Reggie stands for everyday world price. Are there any retailers you're aware of, they're known for everyday world price? All right. All right. Smith, they have what they call a high-speed yield. Outfit. Again, I go with a lot of these. But the thing of high low, those are what you most use in Taylor's world. If you put things on sale frequently, you have a high low price and strategy. If you're hardly ever on sale like Walmart, that's an everyday world price strategy. So what you'll do is, if I'm negotiating with Walmart, I'm going to go in and figure out what the trade would be. For a year round promotion. Okay. Now, I might, let's say, let's say they have a price just $2.99. And they want to be lower every day, the target, every day targets the trade. Let's say I can do that. Usually, if I discount their over target, I might take you down to $2.49. And I might do that four times. That makes sense. So the amount that I would spend on that, what I'll do is, I'll say, okay, what do you look for that dollar back? What could I get for Walmart? And so what I'll do is, I'll say, if I do this, if I instead of doing four times a year, I'm going to mark the scale. I'll send you those deep discounts, the highs and the lows. I'm just going to find out how much your salt sends the entire year. And I'm just going to give you that month's amount of all. And so instead of being $2.99, everybody might be $2.95. So if you go into target, you're going to buy $2.95, or it's $2.99. Or if you go into Walmart, you're going to be $2.95 instead of Walmart, that target, $2.99. Every day. But then, when you do target on the high lows, there are going to be a lot less expense than you need. On those big discounts. Does that make sense? So that's the way the trade works for everyday low prices. Okay, so let's say that you're going into an ELP, a real low price at $2.99. How much money would we need to give them? What is the trade that we would need to give them per case? Okay, so here's a little bit tricky. Remember the equation. What's the equation? Price equals what? Variable cost, divided by? One minus one. One minus that margin target. Okay, so let's ask, what do we have? What's the $2.99 represent? That's the price we have. What is the margin that they want? $3.5. We just don't know how much we need to sell to them for. So, do the outburst. Okay, go ahead and see if you can figure out what the trade would need to be. Who do you be able to get this, this, this? How much do we need to give them per case? What do you think? $3.5. You can team up again. What do you think? $3.5. $3.5. That's your number. $1.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. The manufacturer charges. What is that? What is that? What is that? $3.5. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $2.9. $1.9. $1.9. $3.7. But the trade is different between what they charge and what you charge. They're like, we know it's $2.41 a unit, but we want you to get it to us. Well, $1.94 a month. And so, you have to make a crack here. We can get you a cash discount. That's one of the best. I'm like so close by. I'm not sure if you're going to get it now. I'm not sure if you're going to get it now. I'm not sure if you're going to get it now. This is all very important. All right, so let's get it over here. The difference between the first price and the next price. So, if you're starting to scratch once again, take that $1.31 divide by $8.41. That is the regular price that I would sell to a retail. That's their variable cost. Let me explain. Now, what I want to do now is I want to be able to utilize this equation and start plugging the variable into trade with this thing. What is the new variable cost that I need to offer to have to tips that price point? So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take now because of algebraic rules, I'm going to take, I'm trying to figure out what variable cost is. I'm going to take that $1 minus the margin and now flip it over here. Now, I'm not widening, now I'm holding it. So, I've got the $2.99 price. We'll supply it now by one line step and three five. Everybody follow that? When I do that, I know I get $1.94. So, it gives me $1.94. Okay, so, what does that mean? That's how much target wants you as the manufacturer to sell it to them. That's right. And what am I selling it for now? Two for you to do it. Two for you. Two for you. So, I've got to now take that difference to give them that rebate trade. So, what I'm going to do next is I'm going to sell it to you. I'm going to take that $2.41 regular price. I now know how much I need to charge that to get the margin and the risk of the price. I know. Okay, I was wrong. And I'm going to just take that one and then that gives me $1.97. Now, do I sell for unit or do I sell by case? I can. I'm going to take that $1.97, more to apply that to my 8th. And now I've got $376. Does that make sense? So, the problem with the answer is that if you're curious, who has a higher margin than the retailer who paid back to the full utility? It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best. It's only the best.

Here's the other thing. So if you're on a quiz on exam, if you're not sure if you got this right, just complain into the PNL from retail perspective. So what is my growth sales going to be right? The four food target. How much are they charging? 19 per unit. 2.99. 2.99. They're not going to be paying out in any trade. So the net sales are at it's 2.99. If we give them that trade, what is their cost? One, nine, four. Okay, they're four to the difference. There's five, zero, five. Is that what you got? Okay, if I do the gross margin, divided by net sales, I'm going to go 1.05 divided by 2.99. What am I getting? 35%. That's what you know you're getting. Questions on this interview? Okay, so key. They should understand how to do this math. Okay, if you're working with a corporation that is any type of sales, and most corporations do business to business, think about what that means for the trade perspective. Okay, understand how to do this markup, understand how margin is. This is math, we need to mark it all this time. Okay, let's go on. So, we have a chance to play with this now. Now let's... Here's what I just did on this. All right, now the other thing that I would say is, let me go with this thing. So let's say you take something like, let's say you want to do a buy one, get one free, it's a shop. Okay, so what would be the on shelf discount? If you percent, so if I'm normally $2.99, what's my price at shelf, and if it's a buy one, get one. $2.99. Good, good, good, get it. By the way, can I teach you something? If you go to the store shelf and if you see something off, it's like a free for free or buy for five deal, then we have to do multiples. Unless it explicitly says on that tag, you have to buy five to get the discount, you get the discount on one. Do all of you know that? No, it's not your last one. No, it's not your last one. No, it's not your last one. It's not your last one. No, it's not your last one. It's not your last one. All right. Now we better just start now about the channel. Today, what I want to do is just to prove what we did today. The channel is dope and hopeless. You know what I mean? All right, now to start this off, I thought I gave some deep thoughts from the Oracle War. Okay? So it is said that if you know the enemy and, while yourself, your victory will not stand in that. Okay? This next one you're going to recognize. Those who do wind a fight and do not fight are victorious. We'll learn that on company. So these are new. If you are capable, then fight if you are capable. If you are a viewer, then keep away if you are able. And if you're not as good as the fleet, then you're able to. Yeah. I love this. Walk in the path to find a fight rule. In other words, the category rules. And accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight the decisive battle. Now, these are obviously rules for more. Are there true rules when it comes to competition and business here? Are there any competitors that sometimes get so excited that they hop on their soapbox and start, or are they not ready to fight the decisive battle? And what sometimes happens? Okay? Be careful. There are some companies that understand the art of war. I'll give you an example. Underarm. When an underarm came out, they didn't go around and say, hey, take the pre-doll! They didn't do that. They didn't really quite. It lost originally. They lost too many smaller, sturdy goods stores with a compression chip. That product was pretty unique, pretty different. They got rid of it. And they slowly quietly built the bottom. The man started getting higher in those regional smaller areas. The regional, you know, the dicks in the store, they started the people were asking for it. They didn't get there. So they started asking for it. So underarm, they started shipping for them. So without a lot of advertising, without a lot of fanfare, without a lot of anything, underarm, slowly built this product and this name, kind of beneath the radar. And then finally, when they were big and Nike finally realized that they were losing share of them, it was too late. They had to even have pockets that could defend themselves. They could actually advertise, they could expand a different category. When we in business go out, if we are not thoughtful, we might awaken the dragon that might hurt us. So be careful. Be careful. Now, this competition, a good thing about that. Good. And this new, both. Both. Explain. Why is it good? As a consumer, why is it good? The prices, the option, the formation. There's a lot of good. What about us individually? Is competition good or bad? Is it good that you have to convince each other to do a job? What does it help to do? Does it push you to strive to become a better man? That's a good thing. Look, we know competition is been around for us. Think about some things competitors. Two people kind of do get it out. Who are some? God and Satan. There you go. Good. So we'll just start at the very beginning. I wish you were good. And because of that, we know that there must be opposition and all things. We want this. We have shoulder angels right now. It's going to tempt us and encouraging us and all those different things. Now, what about it in the world of business? Co-compatients. Co-compatients are good. Back you need a good apple marketer. So apple actually tons of different competitors out there. And sometimes you can get pretty nasty and sometimes you can be pretty friendly. I think all of you know that I'm really like sports. I'll tell you this right now is coming up next week. It's one of my favorite games of the year. But there are more times when I need it. In some way, especially when it's not music or lyrics. But I love to come on. It's got it. And I love that he and Coach Witting have a better relationship. It doesn't have to be in vitriol. So a little friendly tip to competition is this good. You know, maybe even politics that might have nothing to do with you. That was great. That's great. Two sides. Let me plug it out a little bit. Alright. So let's talk a little bit about the competition. Let's say your boss comes to you to your job. And your boss says, hey, we need to do our four seasons. I like you go out there and learn just much about competition. You got to do it. I need an approach step. Any thoughts? What do you want to work with? Right. Companies with similar products or offerings and services first just identify who's doing a similar thing or providing a similar product or service. And then maybe like a similar size similar market. Okay, good. So I love that. So first we've got to identify who it is. We have to go out there and we have to understand who they are. And then we're going to start discussing. Okay, so you got that's what's going to be. Before we do that, should we ask a business audience? Oh, it's a good question. Is it a smart competitor? Hello. I mean, if you're going to do C company, is that something that will give you insight? Any other things? What else are you going to do? I'll say you can assess the competition. What else are you going to look at? We need a friend of the industry, you're in but where they're placed, where they're putting their products, how they're displaying their products, their packaging. Is that fair? Is that something you want to know? Yeah, I mean, understand what they're promoting. What they're, you think about the four piece of marketing? If their products look like how they're different from yours. How they're placing them with now. They're promoting. Is that something that's going to give you an essential strategy? Big of an industrial impact. I might be thinking about it a little bit too much, but I don't just go through the other three scenes. Oh, good. Well, everybody in here. Well, that's all. Good. Can we do the four Cs for our competitor? You have to. And I would hope that's what we need. So there's so much that we can go into here. So if your boss ever does come up to you, you can definitely go through your four Cs. That's going to help you, come up my bed. I'm going to give you a couple of the things to consider today. All right? So if your boss ever goes, says, hey, go learn about the competition. Here's a couple considerations that I want you to make sure you enjoy before you do this type of competition. All right? So first. Brad, you nailed it on the head. One of the first things that we have to do that most people don't understand is you have to identify who your competition is. Is that easy or hard? It depends. Depends. Love that business school, that's your. Why does he think that? You know what? You could be in different markets. So if we are, there is my change in paying one part of business here with me. Oh, interesting. Okay, so let's play with a little bit of that. So the first thing I want you to do is I need you to spot your competition. You have to spot them and assess them. Okay? To win, you've got to probably understand who they are. So we're going to play a little game really quick. Everybody really just pull out a piece of paper. I'm going to give you one minute. We have a little game, you can go in right and post competitors for getting the product. Okay? You can go in one minute. Ready? Go in your product and just have a little bit of nostalgia for me. You know what I'm going to show you? Ready? No. I want you in the next 60 seconds to write down as many products that compete with this product. Okay? Ready? The I-O's plug in. Oh my God. Oh, Marshmallow with dark chocolate and cocoa. Ready? You got 60 seconds. Mark is in. What? That is you can't. What's that? Don't type this. That's you. You got it right. It was like coconut flakes on top of it. Yeah, it's broken up like that. Yeah, it's Marshmallow with dark chocolate and cocoa. It's definitely going to be fine. Okay. You have to go in first. Okay. Is it international? I'm hard. 20 seconds. Oh my God. You go in. You might as well use your hands. Or go for products or company. Plus. I thought it was going to make sure in. Five, four, three, two, one, and one. Okay, count them up. Seven, five, and one, and one. And nine. I'm going to count it. Yeah. You're still going. All right. Okay, so I must ask for something. Anything you have this product. Now. Hey, Bonnie. Yeah. Want to give a testimony? I mean, you're fine. It's a treat. My mom would do it like small time. And so, like, this for her was a staple growing up. And so, I could do this for her. So, I don't know. I don't know. Do you give up on you? Yeah. I have a lot of experience. I'm doing right now. And so, I'm not having those before. And then, I have a huge impression. I'm not trying them, but they're in a different shape themselves in competition. Yeah. My honest opinion. For those of you that haven't tried this product. Don't. That's fine. That's not great. But it makes people good at that. All right. You have every state talent at the beginning of our afternoon. But that is what it does. All right. So, get them up. How many do you have more than five? Keep them up. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Whoa. 13. You're going to want to be 14. 14. 16. 16. You're going to get it. I'm going to get it. 17. 17. Let's give her a round of applause. 17. That's a good question. Who knows if this is actually competition. But Snickers Kit Kat, Payday, Malm, All-Enjoy, Reese's, Sticks, Reese's, and I have three children. Five. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. I like to get a little scattered horse. I'm going to be like, yeah. Okay. Did any of you have other competitors that were mentioned, Payton? I said cow tails. Cow tails. I think cow tails. I think cow tails. Okay, others. I like Cheetos, and I don't know. Cheetos. Okay. How about Cheetos? What do you think? How do you like, no. Cheetos, no. I think they were. All substitute. So give her a rationale. Why should Cheetos be? I wrote things you can get at the gas station. I just assumed you could get an absolute gas station. Okay, so if you're hiring an idle spy, what are you hoping to do? Having a snack. Good Cheetos. Satisfied craving. Is it considered a snack? Could we expand the competition? Maybe a little bit. More beyond just chocolate bars. Please turn it. Is that twiggy and snowballs? Twiggy and snowballs? Yes, fair. Can we make a sandwich? We're going to be there. It's good, Jacob. Oh, Fennant will help you. Come on. No, but is that, is that for you? You're going to be there. Yeah. Thanks, Dick. Bill Puffs. Bill Puffs? Oh, fair. I have this one like a marshmallow chocolate. So I actually said marshmallows, first you can you borrow this. Oh, there it goes. Sure. There. That's a great, great. Thank you, girls. So what are we doing here? You see how sometimes, you have additions to lots of hard-earned spots. You see that? Sometimes we as individuals, create it and lots of strengths. We love the barrel things, categories, as a blind. But are we really looking at all the competitors that might be hired from the same position? Yeah, please out. Along? I'm just curious, kind of where I'll pick up this, because I have a hard time feeling like this in these increases. All of a sudden. Because like five walko looking for a recent, there's no end in the sway by this, that could be. And so like in some ways I would like very interesting to like expand into snacks, but also like, if I'm on chips, I'm not going to do anything with it. I'm curious as well. That's why I should stop writing. No, I think it's fair. So what should I say to Alex here? I think it's not competing with you when you want a recess. It's you when you want a snack. That's it? Right, but like, with their next to each other. Did you notice existed before this now? No. So they had no mind share. But if you had your mind share, it's one of your considerations, then you're more likely to overtake them. Even now I know today. That's how it went. That's not about it. That's not about it. Well, there's also basically like, if I know I want a snacker, I do not really sway my quits. That's right, but there still are. Are you eating it? Is that fair? So let's have. I have each one of you remember something I consumer. Each one of you gave you the best out sign. What was he doing? I am not all I said I can't say. I don't know. Are there some consumers like Alex, who says, okay, nothing is going to happen to me. You bet. They're having a whiz. Okay? For me, take clients. Awesome. I'm loving that product. Okay? That's a great product. But there are some of you that like, I like variety reasons. I'm going to be a variety speaker when it comes to snacks. I guess I have to sit. I like that. It's dangerous trying to start the night of those. But we're like, you want me to start under a mirror? Yeah. They didn't go try to take down Nike right away. So I guess like some, which is like, my mind, Nike is like the racism of the Snickers. Yeah, whatever, this thing. And so I guess like, from a strategic standpoint, maybe your real competition is other vocal. Good. Good. Okay, so I'm loving going. So can I play again? No, I'm messing up. What happens if your objective is to get the tourist? Could now, instead of you going against Reese's, now you're going against, you got this box of idle spots, sat or a t-shirt. Could they be against each other? Or a t-chain. Okay, I'll read it. Or a postcard. I'm going to drop my phone. So, it's hard to get. It's hard to get. So that's the whole book. Exactly what's the purpose. Why we need to identify this. A front. It's not all the same thing it is. I mean, think about it if you live in a world in which you don't have very many barriers to entry. How do you like to compete in tech? If you're not a code, or if you know a little AI, you can create a product pretty much tonight. Yeah. Now, doesn't mean you're going to be successful. But could you? Because I mean, it's the competitor. Sure. How would you like that? So here's something I want to teach you over quick. There are different levels of competition. Therefore, the first one is called form competition. And I'm going to give you examples of the life of each one of these. The second one is what we call category competition. The third one is generic competition. And the fourth one is budget competition. Okay. Now, to give you an example, budget competition can be a lot of different things. At the end of the day, go and create a product and compete for our knowledge. I can, my household, I might have a budget set aside. I might have saved a few dollars. And I might have a cruise competing against the new mattress, competing against the TV entertainment set. They might all be competing against each other. They have no idea. But I'm going to choose how to share my, you know, how to spend those dollars. So in a way, they are budget competition. Now, that's way too broad for us to be able to look at everybody. Because everybody can get some better. But can we narrow down, like, sometimes instead of share a wallet, people would say share a stuff. Coca-Cola does this. Coca-Cola says, I don't just look at other beverages anymore. I look at food too. Because if you're filling up on I know Spuds, that's less room for Coca-Cola. Share a stuff and you can just come down. So there's different levels. And we've got to think about it. So for example, let's give an example. Here's a new product, die-coco-picking. All right, so we've got die-coco-picking. I'll be starting here. This is not really only on the services. All right, so let's give die-coco-picking. If you're buying something diet, what's the main benefit of it? No calories. No calories, products, baby. If I wanted to look at the form competition, I might say, I think it's going to be die-coco-picking. Okay, I get a spike in caffeine, I get a flavor profile similar. This is what I would consider form competition. I'm going against die-c, die-darkly-pap, or those types of things. That's my form competition. Now, is that the only competitor that they really have? Of course not. So now, I might expand that and look at who else is in the category. Think about the aisle. Who else do you compete with? Now look at all soft drinks. Fully loaded, energy drinks, I'm looking at all those carbonated soft drinks. That makes sense? Now, is that the only people that are competing against what comes to hydration? What else can claim the role? What else could be hired for hydration? Water. Juice. Water. Well, milk, gatories, powerings. Come on, powerings. There's all these different beverages that we might need. Are we considered milk? Chewy. Okay, and then, as you want to go even further, could you look at it for the share of stomach protection? Now, will it be all food growth? Does that make sense? Okay. You see how we can look at this because of competitive perspectives? And this has real consequences. So, let me give you an example. How many of you know this graph? Okay. All of us are familiar with code act. How many of you have told us code act lately? Are there no other ways? No, they're gone. Four hundred years. This is one of the most successful companies in the world. For a hundred years, during the year 2000, they did a big magazine article on the brands of the century. Top 10. And five years later, it was gone. Why? You have to code act. It's okay, I'm just a camera driver, right? So, let me ask. We talked about earlier, you're talking about what business are we in. Right? Where are they in the business city? Build a building. They looked at them. We are in the build development business. Okay, so therefore who's our competition? Other build foodgy fill, conica. Those are the two big ones. And so, in a fall, we're looking at those religiously. They were not about to let them still share them. But then all of a sudden, other competitors started looking at this... Now, all of a sudden the relation comes to your end. Digitally. And the competition looks at this and says, we might be able to steal some share and not to invest all these plants that does fill. We might be able to play right away. Zero's and ones, we can do that. Okay? Code Act. Ignored them, is why? And the film business. And what they did is they were so focused on Fuji film and tie it. Just staring at it. Here's what we're doing. That they missed all the other layers of competition that might be hired to do the same thing that they were really into. So it's called competitive myopia. When you focus so much on your form of competitions, you forget about everybody else and you may start making big sentences. Now, here's the crazy thing. Do you know the development, digital photography? Code Act. Code Act. And they watched it and they didn't get support in either because they were in the film business. And the competition saw it and said, oh, great. And now, what actually? So be mindful. Don't get stuck in competitive myopia. Myopia means near sightedness. If any of you are near sighted, you know how blurry things can be. Okay? Don't get stuck into that one. Now, so we've got to first identify, we've got spot. Then we need to assess. Now, how do you assess competition? There's a gazillion things, right? And we think about, let's take a score. Hundreds of hours of film go in. 14 for a Super Bowl. They have two views. And they're analyzing every group, every team, all the different things that they play. They're looking at hundreds of hours of film. All the effort to make sure that they understand who they're going up against, to tell what they have, what the tenancies of the coaches are. What the tenancies on the team are on different areas. Huge amount of time, all in analysis. And if they don't do this, what will happen to them during the Super Bowl? What happened to them? They will likely lose. They will likely lose. They will be ready for it, right? They should have fled. Now, there are other equations out there that will have us assess competition. One of them is four or five forces. This helps us understand both competition and chess for a second. We do an analysis of both of those. Compare those out. But there's no understanding of crash events in Denmark. We can also move just look like I think was, I can't remember who said this. Maybe Jeff, right here. But we talked about dollars, like we can go out there and look at Eelson and IRI to see what our competition is doing pretty good. What they choose to do in pricing helps us learn about the strategy. Where they're selling their product helps us learn about their strategy. We can learn right now, like we had my advanced break class, we had Walmart having to talk to us this last week. And they're talking about the importance of their distribution strategy. If they want to be on the channel strategy later, but they don't want to just be in the computer, they want to really have a strong teaching effort with digital. If you look at their strategies and what they're doing, you can totally see that that's a huge improvement. You can see how they're doing their sorting it up. You can see that this is a key thing. And so you can learn what people are investing in online, what keywords they're playing. Are you leveraging that to your net? Are you really digging deep enough to understand the competitors? If you look at the book or in a marketing textbook, this is what they're going to tell you to do. You need to understand their objectives. You also need to understand their current strategies. So you're going to go out there and make sure you understand what their four P's are. Look at their segmenting and their targeting. You also then go to create a swap for them. Can you do that? Yes. When I was in industry, we would also have one member of our brand team play the foil and would always do a swap from the competitors perspective. So we can now understand what's going to happen next. Then we compare our plans to their plans and then key. Then we say, okay, if we do this, remember this? Whenever we make a choice, what do we do next? Or see? So are you doing multiple step things? And if I choose the strategy, what are they going to do with reaction? And even better. And if they do that, what are we going to do? And even better. They do that. And we do this. Are you doing multiple step thinking? I made your familiar game through. Okay, good. So we can take the brand and we're going to be doing it. It's fun. But these are the things that we need to do. So we need to spot first and assess. Alright, just spot. The next thing we do, if you look at that book, what was it? We swap. So when we spot, optician, we assess them and then we swap. Okay, we've already got to swap into an external, I'm not going to go into that anymore. But the goal is to make sure you fortify your weaknesses. Okay, kind of like we talked about Captain Moron and I, right? It was the king of swat. Making sure that you understand where you need to go up your quarters. So it's a center. So you spot and then you swap. Now the next one is one that's off the list. And it can be really helpful. We swap. So spot, we swap and then we swap. We try to understand visually and politically how close our competition really is too much. So let me show you how this works on a very easy way. Okay? All of you are considered reaching all purchased this product. You know what you're going to be in, right? Okay, what are some of the key drivers for you in your maintenance decision? What were some of the variables that you were considering in your maintenance choice? What was one of the reasons why you came to view it? Cops. Cops. And some cops. What else? Quality. Quality and what? I'm an education. Okay, good. So we'll talk about the education quality. Location. Good. Location. Good. What else? Renky. What do you have to be said? Network. Keep going. Future revenue. Good. So what's the salary? Per difference. It's not curriculum. For decades. Good. Ethics. Not so far. It's not curriculum. It's not curriculum. It allows you to profess it. But that. There's a lot of ways that we can go into it, right? So we put it back. And we keep on going, is that fair? Okay. So what I do, if I'm doing some market research and doing some primary research in Geneshan, why consumers are comfortable? If I know that there are different consumers of value different things, I'm going to go out there and understand what they are. And I'm going to have a right. I'm going to say, okay, at PYUS, scale of one to ten. If you want to buy a Spence of one to scale. On a scale of one to ten, how does it be what you do? For an NE. Ten. Really good. How about the education quality? Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. How about the education quality? Ten. Really good. How about the education quality? Two. Two. Okay, so what do you get? Six. Six. Breaking. I would say I'm there with you. 30, so 40. So we're up, we're in top 35, but I mean that's okay. Okay, there's up 70. That's right. That's our big rule. General. Network. I think we're going to have something like nine. Sour. That looks nice. Eight, four, nine. We're going to, are you doing them? Five. Eight. Nine. Nine. Ethics. Zero. Ten. Faculty. Ten. Ten. Eleven. So nice. Hey, now let's do it for another one. Okay, let's go. Three. Three. Four. Three. Three. Three. Ten. If you look at what like let's just look at what their퍸 They sayfl. Negative. Yeah. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. Ten. I'm not a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. I'm a power ten. How did you rate yourself? Arbor, 20, 30. Try this. I'm a power ten. You're going to say that. And I'm going to find out, okay, there's going to be some different things for some of you. The most important what we call dynamic variables is spirit. Right here. Well, that is stuff. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Here. It's going to be number one for some of you. Now, it's Harvard going to play in that game for a lot of our students. No. But are there some things that Harvard, that every MBA program, can be done? Yes. How about like the job, please? Yeah. Is that something everybody kind of worries about? Yeah. So I'm going to look at maybe the jobs, I'll say the net worth, I'll put the jobs right here. This is something that all of us are going to compete against. I'm going to call that the main variable. So the main variable is kind of like the price to play. It's what everybody needs against. The dynamic variables are the ones that everybody's a little bit different. And some targets are going to be terrible with the value. And so what I'm going to do, what I'm talking about, I'm going to do this market research. And then I'm going to literally sit in on, I'm going to start graphing to see how close the competition really is to us. And depending on the target, I'm going to choose everything. So let's say something as easy as music. Music, there's a lot of dynamic variables, why you might choose a type of music product. Let's say they actually something like speakers or something like that. On my y-axis, I put what we call the main variable. Typical rule of thumb, that's what we call. No, no, it's typically. Rule of thumb is my y-axis is my main variable. It's the quality of the music. My x-axis is going to be my dynamic variable. And that will vary depending on my target. So I have my quality here. Let's say for music, my dynamic could be something like convenience. It could be a lot of, it could be price, it could be design, it could be a lot of. Let's say I've got a consumer that really value convenience. And now I'm going to start listing out all the impediments. I'm going to look at these scores and see how they're rich. Like concerts, they're going to rank really high when it comes to quality sound. Sure. Okay, depends on who you go. Okay, but if you look at like the old style record players, the low quality sound and the convenience wasn't very good. Not going to be running around with a 78 LP, I'm sure. Okay, so not very good. So what you'll do is you're going to go out there and start laying out all these different players. A, M, R, F, M, R, T, R, A tracks, stereo, CDs, MP3. And you're going to start looking and say, oh my goodness, there's actually some white space in here. What we could play, where we could actually listen really low-convenient to higher quality in here. Or who you can play up here where the quality and convenience are up here. You think about like what the R stuff is going to do. They're trying to put up in here. Are these all arbitrary members? We're just being like, yeah, this is I think we're 45 singles good. Or are you doing like servings? Totally arbitrary, I'm just doing it. But these are how we calculate. And when you're in the field doing it yourself, you just say, this is how I think our break's on cost. No. You're doing it? I think we talked to all the target audience. And get their perspectives. Does that make sense? So then I might do the end-to-end design. And I might do it again for price. And I'm going to back in those batches. But what I can find is when I do this, I can find out which competitors actually have really close to us. And which ones really important? It also gives us the opportunity to see white space. And how fluttered a market might be. How many of you have heard the term red ocean? What does that mean? So many competitors, you want to play the game? They get it from Shark Week, right? If you throw turns to the water and a lot of competitors, sharks come out with it with the color of the water. Lot of sharks come, red ocean. Okay. Blue ocean means there's not as many competitors. It doesn't get this bloody in this. So by mapping and plotting these out, now all of a sudden you can see what is yours and what you can really own. And now all of a sudden you don't have to always compete for every single consumer. You've got to own a second to category. So this is a great powerful tool to look at. So you spot, you slot, and then you plot, and then you take your shot. Okay. All right. Good question. Yeah. Is there a way to visualize multiple dynamic variables against the main variables? Yes, there is. You go to the advanced brand of red. Yes. There's multiple dimensions. Just to make sure I understand. This is what we have in common. So why is what everybody plays on? So for example, why are you going to fast food? Right? What's the main variable? Convenience. Convenience. Fast food is convenience. Dynamic variable. Good taste. Good quality. Good quality. All right. Costs could be a variety. Could be a lot of it. Does that make sense? Yeah. So it's kind of the price to play. Is that main variable in everything? It makes sense. Is that what kind of like our points of parity? Yeah. Yeah. Is that point of parity? Okay. So folks, at the end of the day, remember to your foresees. When you go into competition, when you want to stand them, the better you assess them. And when you visually understand where you're playing well, it's a two-year-old. You're going to choose to win the win. To know what is your best stuff. Spock them. Spock them. Spock them. All right. Good. See you later."
