  "text": "Okay, so this is going to be two parts. Please, again, do your work together, teach each other, hope it will help everyone, and hope you learn more effectively. Some of that teaching something, you really can master things, but you can start teaching it to someone else. So obviously we're going to be kicking it off today. The deadline is going to be due on this upcoming Saturday, day on the 30th of the afternoon, midnight. You'll be submitting it via Canvas, I'll turn it in. And then a couple of things. So the assignment, how many of you have actually opened up the spreadsheet? Okay, so about third of you. Now, how fun does that spreadsheet look? Super fun. So fun. How many of you looked at it and were like, yes. Okay, good. It's money. A little bit. Good attitude. That's good. You're going to take your money. Dang. Okay, that's probably what we want to do. So here's what we're going to do. You're going to find that in this data set, there are different brands and their performance in a lot of different adventures. This is an actual poll from about, I think, scrubbed it. So I may have changed the numbers quite a bit. But this is an actual poll that, trajectoryally, we really simply want you to see in market. You'll see a lot of different types of measures, valor sales, volume, distribution measures, different types of promotion measures. All these measures are things that are going to help you understand the health of your business in a getting time period. You'll also notice that when you get in, there's going to be a huge monster spreadsheet. Then you'll notice that there's multiple tabs as well. That monster spreadsheet is going to help you understand the entire category while the tabs will be for the specific retailers. So a smaller subset of that category. All right, so make sure you don't forget about the extra tabs. All right, it'll help you do your side more in that category. Now, there are, as I mentioned, there are multiple brands that are there. I'm not going to have you do an analysis of all the brands, just one specific brand. All right, so everybody write this down. If you are on team one or two, please write down that you have brand C. Whenever you have a business question, where do you always always start? Four, four, three, four, three, C. C, right? I'm going to put this down. All right, so brand C, brand three, four, brand E. Is it elephant? Brand five and six are going to be, we're going to brand J. Team seven and eight, brand O. Brand nine or T nine, you're going to be brand P, Peter Paul. And then last but not least, brand 10, you're going to be brand P. Ooh, right. Okay, all right, so as Parker mentioned, this is going to be a review session that will help you. Today we'll be guiding his numbers and help you diagnose it. Only simplify things a little bit and at least give you a review, understand how to break things down simply. But it's going to be able to, I'll be honest with you, it's going to kind of feel like a fire host today. It will, you'll learn a new acronym, a lot of new terms, but with repetition, as you continue to look at it, it will be easier to be easier to be. Okay, so the review session should help you. It's going to be Thursday, five to seven, or six thirty over T and B, two fifty one, we got it right here, all right? And that's a room game. So I put something Monday, but it's new for a bigger room. So you write it down, is there got to be a two fifty one? So as long as it's not on this side, it's going to be on the other side. Okay, so two fifty one. We will record this if you can't make it. We'll make sure that we publish this on Canvas, okay? Now, in addition to this, we also have TA hours, so we're going to be available to you. And so remember the office hours, these are all going to be held in room three, three, six. This is where our TA's have their offices. Partridge is going to be Thursday from 11 to noon and Friday from 12 to noon to 23. So if you can't make this, or if you need additional help, come take advantage of these times, and hopefully you get to make some sense out of the query. Laney is going to be available Thursday to three and Friday 11 to noon. So only between the new session and TA sessions hopefully we'll be able to help you. Okay, any questions? All right, now the other thing that I would recommend, make sure you download those data sets. Now notice that I need three things in that I've created before. Like three things. There's a big data set you want to download that because if you try to do it through the web, it's pretty complicated, doesn't come up as clear. So make sure you do that. There's also another presentation that actually is from IRI and ACNLson. They teach us some of their concepts. They teach you some of them, but just to look at from a different perspective sometimes helps. And then there's going to be a list of jargon, some acronyms and what they mean, and how to use these things, hopefully those will help. Okay, so make sure you leverage all of them and teach each other if you have questions for each other. All right, last time, here we have the chance to talk about marketing strategy. And we specifically walk through the Harvard Business Framework. That's the number. Harvard Business Framework, again, is a great model just to make sure you're to think about marketing, business, and the holistic perspective. So you're not forgetting some of the key players in the game. Whenever you have the business question, where do you all start? Or are you too good? Now we get into a view of what and then the how. And then when we're done with that how, what do we do next? CRM good. And once you start making that sale and start making those strategic choices, what do you do after that? Do you go all the way back up? Go all the way back up to make sure you ask, what will happen next? If I make this price, and choice will happen to my four cents, right? That's gonna make sure that we're good, so strategic thinking is just being what our competition might do and how the consumers might react. So make sure you don't forget about that very important step. So memorize this, get this down. Earlier you memorized this, the federal league. When you use this all semester long, we're gonna anchor this in your thinking, make sure you got it. We also talked about some other frameworks. They're strategic to help you understand. If you want to understand C company, one of the frameworks that you could potentially use is to analyze your portfolio of products through the DCG group. This is something that'll help you look at things from your respective, and hopefully makes you good at solace your changing choices. Another seek first to understand for C type model. We then introduce you to the model of the framework of SWOT, okay? Can you have an internal opportunity? No, not according to SWOT, okay? Opportunities are always always external, okay? Right, some weaknesses are always. They're internal, so make sure you get that. And then, don't just separate things into different houses, okay? You could play a game. Now leverage it. Look out, they can buy. How can you leverage and capitalize those strengths and leverage those to invest in an opportunity? Let that be the genesis for some really good strategic opportunities, okay? Let's look at that and see what we can do, okay? So we talked about those different options. We also talked about the key of doing market research. We talked about the importance of understanding causation versus correlation. Now, this sounds so basic, but do big Fortune 100 companies make mistakes like this all the time. Unless you've got a gazillion dollars to test every single thing, there's a good chance you're gonna be looking at correlation instead of going to the same thing, okay? Now it doesn't mean you're gonna be wrong, per se. But be careful, right? And just to show you this, we did this little example. How many of you thought that we should cut bait and switch? More than half the price. Now, we assumed that that packaging change was causation, but was it really? Still more, right? But could it have been just correlation? I'm gonna research by going and asking additional questions. Getting that in the back just a little bit more, find labels and make sure we're not making any difference cause we want to use this correlation. So we thought, all right. Now, let's talk a little bit more about research before we do one. For you, why is research so critical? Why do we need to do research? Or do, court? Because I had far as your decision, right? Good, so you gathered data for make better decisions. Good, what else? Yeah, at least, I feel like I'm wrong so often about so-called things. And research is like, at least an attempt to like get what's actually happening. What's actually true? Good. How often are you wrong? You're not wrong. Thanks. I mean, listen to Dan Snow earlier today. How often is Dan Snow wrong? I'm not wrong. So, it's good to have a good gut. How do you give your breath bleak? Not bad, well. Great book. Here's someone that he talks about, people that, even without doing research, because of their history and because of their abilities and really understand why he's thinking see something and just know it, okay? We call that the golden gut in business. They just, they can look at it, they can see it, they're really good at that. But not everybody is that. A lot of us will be humble and say, you know what, I don't know everything. And a lot of times I make mistakes, we all do. And so, going out there and proving your ideas and be able to, at least going to be good, favorite effort to try to make a better decision. Hopefully it's the right decision. Here's one of the things that you'll find. Upper management usually is very good at coming up with new ideas. And we're gonna find that. What about? But I'll tell you what we're really good at, poking holes in yours. We're good at that. You'll sit down and you'll be in front of all of upper management and you'll pitch your idea and you'll be surprised at some of the great questions that they asked. They just said they're gonna, I should have thought of this. I'll have to get back to you. There's some people, if they're using the golden gut, where those discussions aren't gonna go very well. However, if you do do your research, doing your four C's and understanding and doing this market research, and I can almost act like a bull proof of death. Where they can ask you a question, you're ready for it, you're prepared for it. You can say, well, this will be fun in research. And you can explain the why. And that's what our goal is to be solid in businesses. It's a why. I hope you understand why things are the way they are. Did it work right? Now, to do market research, there are some nice basic things you can explore. I mean, well, I'll be excited to start. Now, let's simplify this a little bit. There's generally two forms of basic market research. Two forms. There is secondary market research and primary market research. What do you think that means? What's the difference between this two? Please, Jacob. Secondary, do you like academic papers and things that have been read about it? Primary research, do you like the talk? Okay, good. So primary might be something you do where you go out and interview someone. Where secondary might be something somebody else did, being prepared for another reason. But might be relevant to your situation. Yeah. Primary usually is primary sources. It's straight from organization or straight. You can see where it's worth signingary. But it's a pretty little bit of it. Okay, that's very, very, very. Okay, does that make sense? So pretty basic. Now, in primary, this is one where you are actually going to go gather the data to be able to prove your hypotheses, right? Pretty simple stuff. There are basic forms, there's basic types of primary research. The first one is where we form our hypotheses. Okay, these are usually less expensive. Usually a lot less formal. But it can only give you an idea of some potentially the places you go. So for example, if you want to go to informal research, how many of you have had a business idea and you've gotten to a friend saying, what about this, what do you think? And if you've done that, congratulations, you did market research. How many of you have been on a date? Okay, congratulations, you've done some of our research. Those are all things where we're exploring. So an informal might be just a quick conversation with anybody, convenience interview. Okay, qualitative, I say, no, when you start getting an equalizer, that is more formal, now you're creating something like a focus group. So then you get a part of a focus group. What's a focus group? What is that? So we bring in our smaller group of people that generally are similar in their makeup. And we throw questions out of them, trying to understand and trying to get different viewpoints from that group. It's less of like trying to like through something, but maybe a little more on the explore side. That's exactly it. So if Dan and I wanted to learn how we can improve the idea of a group, and what we might do is we might take a random sample of the consumer. And we might buy you to come sit down. We'll have our moderator to come in and ask you good questions. And then go and just to learn. That is a form of primary research we've been particularly consider that quality. Focus groups is the only kind of there's a lot of in quality research, but that's one that's usually now are these perfect? Can you get faulty data in a focus group? Yes. And if you don't do a focus group well, and if you don't use the best practices, you can really be misledged. So be very, very careful. In industry, we used to call focus groups that crack cocaine and wonder research. That's seriously, that's what they call it. Because it was cheap and because it would give you a false disorder, it's really out. So be mindful of that. Now, can you improve the viability? Yes. If you do it the appropriate way. If you ever want to learn, if you, we're not going to go into this in this class. So you can learn about marker research, you can take marker research classes, tons of methodologies, and things. But if you ever want to know how to do it, you can solve a focus group learning. So exploratory quality is something there. We can also do what we call observation. Now what we're doing is we're going to, basically, the other places that are a little bit in the map, not always the map. Like, end the graphic research. If we had a recruit that says, you know, I look at the demographics here at BYU, Married School, and I look at UCLA. On paper, Anderson and Married, their students look really similar. Similar GMATs, similar years of experience, it's a place in all across the nation. They're studying similar things. But if I wanted to go and really understand about UCLA, Anderson, BYU, Married, if I really want to understand, send them here. If you were a researcher in what's a UCLA and watched the Married School students on the weekends, they're versus here in Provo, would you likely see a difference? Yeah, big time. So doing an observation research can be really powerful. Now it doesn't have to be ethnographic. You can actually do false areas, fake areas. We used to do this all the time in business where, if you wanted to watch someone make our product to see if they're following instructions on the back of the package. Or if you wanted to watch people do their laundry, we can do them to see if they have any specific tricks or different things that they might do. How they treat the product. We divided it to a specific place, where like five people who we wanted at the same time, I'll be in class, we'll watch them and try to get them to really insight into what. Those are exploratory, what we just observed. So those are different types of exploratory research. Again, these are usually for building hypotheses. Usually the cheaper way. Now, once you've got a hypothesis, and if you now want to prove it, see if it actually does have merit, now you start putting number of different things and now you start getting into what we call the script of Markovishage. Now we're talking surveys, now we're doing Qualtric stuff, now we're doing panels. A lot of different types of surveys and panels that are out there, a lot of ways to get numbers to validate your idea. So if you out there and do a Qualtric saying, you can review something that's pre-civilized, I've got that. If you want to go to a panel, one of the things you could do, there's a type of test, like we're going to read about it a little bit later this semester in case. But there's a test called an i-hut test. It's called an in-home use test i-hut. You don't use tests for pretty basic. You send people products with a questionnaire, you have a user product, and then you have them give you feedback. They're all natural habitat, you're not watching them, but you can send out a thousand of these and a thousand people do them all the same time to get some good numbers. Okay, so that makes sense? So that is a type of descriptive type. Now the best and usually the most expensive, that'll help you find causation in sort of relation is when we get over here, you can call it a positive. Now we're doing experiments, now we're actually modeling things. If you hear, I'm so jealous of what the tech companies can do where they can do A-D testing so quickly and easily, trying to really find cause. And so being able to do things like that can be really, really powerful. There's also cons of different ways of modeling and creating simulations to really understand why something really is happening. Okay, these are usually expensive, they're usually very slow, but you can get them to get them. Now oftentimes corporations will start here, go generate their off-offices, they'll validate them here. And if it's not too risky, they'll go. If it is risky, they might invest in going to the hospital. Generally what determines if you pay the money or not is that the risk of being wrong is significantly more than the risk of doing the risk. The risk of being wrong versus the cost of those you're just doing the research, it'll just do the research and make sure you're a little sick. Or is there a way to do the meeting on AI? Yes, we're gonna talk about that now. Yes, yes. Yes. I'm wondering if it's hard to just try and go backwards like that and get data from a survey and try to understand that data. Yeah, they're just good to get it. Yeah, you can, and actually I've seen that before. Sometimes if you want to get caught, if you think you have a golden guy, sometimes you'll just go straight to that. And if you see something that everything validates, what you're thinking is great. And if you can see that it didn't, what's the validated thing you might go through so far? But usually there were those hypotheses. But no, it was. Okay, so one of the things that you can do is there's a lot of different cool research. There's a format called C-MAT that tries to understand your behavior and the psychology behind your choices. So one of them, so this is the simple exercise, you'll go, let's say you're doing an exercise on hexon mold and you want to understand the power of your brand, you'll go and you bring in some potential consumers, people in the category and say, okay, here's two magazines. I'd like for you to be able to look through the magazines if you see a picture that reminds you of hexon mold. I want you to put it on a piece of paper for me glue it. You're gonna make it a little golden. What's that? Yeah, kind of a co-osh. Now, if you saw this and if you're at some mold, how do you feel about that? Great thing about some types of research is this gives you feeling, okay? And it enables you to be able to hopefully ask some good follow-up questions for the blog. When you do these types of more rich type of research, where you go beyond functional benefits, get some more emotional benefits and the psychological motivation behind most benefits, you can actually get some really rich stuff with more drug extraction. So just know that there's a gazillion different ways of doing that. And again, you only learn more to take the market research class, okay? Now, we give you another example. How many of you feel like you have a pretty good gap? The fan spends on the category, right? That's fair. Okay, let's say that you are running a business and you need to be able to, you've got an idea on how to advertise it. So you're going to invest in money in advertising, and you're about to spend $5 million on an ad that's going to go across the United States. Everybody visualize that? Let's say it's a haircare broom. So you put together this great, you go and you have the great, you have your designers put together the ad, you do your photo shoots, everything looks really, really good and you come up with this product right here. Wake up the red in your hair, okay? Sensor. Now, the designer also gave you another option, and they weren't sure which one would be best. So, as a courtesy, they gave you two options. That happens quite a bit when you're in industry. Here's option A, here's option B. We think they're both on strategy. You tell us which one you like. Here's option B. Wake up the red in your hair, sunset. Okay, now, big difference between the two? What's the difference? What's she's looking at? That's it. Is this perfect for an A, B test? Yes. So, what if we get a little A, B test? So what they'll do is consumers will walk there and we'll test it. Brain management is walking, we'll test these different options for consumers. You don't want to waste life when they dollars, you want them to spend the best. So let's do a quick panel and take a quick poll. Everybody goes right, we hand up the display. I'm gonna give you two options. You're gonna go without an A where she's looking at you or option B where she's looking at the product. I want you to tell me which one you think is gonna be the best for this, which one did you do? Okay, if you believe that the brand manners should go with the top one where the model's looking at you, please open your hand. Okay, very good, thank you. If you believe that you should actually use the other one, the model should be looking at the product, please open your hand. Okay, very good, thank you. Okay, it's about 75, 25 split. 75 is the top. 25 is the bottom. Yeah, you top, why? Why do you like this execution of the app? Please, you fine? I feel like the top one, I'm more attracted to when you love looking at me. I'm just walking on the hallway and I was looking away on the page. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you're in the command section or so I feel like that's the check for the top one. So, command your attention, engage a general. What else does it do for the gauge? When you say engage a commander, what is it for you inside? Pay attention to the other one. Okay, in turn, I just look like what's going on for the wide area. Okay, good. So, you just go to a new level. Okay, why that, others, please pay. I think it aligns with the verb and it's right, it's the whole point is your hair, right? So, that you, thank you. So, it's not wake up the red my hair, it's your hair. I'm wukening you. Right, you got it, you're doing good. I need to meet you to meet you with more that I just bottom on Puzzle Creek. Yeah, that's the same. Like it looks more like a scary movie, like a trailer cover and then, and then add that. So, I'm not like, is there any turning this way in the high-go-even further? I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I think that's fair. Does anybody else goes that way? Just a little creepy. Yeah, good. So, when someone looks at you, what does that say to you? Confidence. Confidence, is it is one more confident than you ever? What? Do you want your hair to be too confident? Okay, maybe. Alright, so let's go to the other folks. Why did you choose the other one? That's easy. So, your drawing is a little bit faces. Look at the top of your eyes. You might not even look at the words. You're just like walking by the ad. Right, the bottom one, look at the face. You see, she's looking somewhere else. Then you look at the pot of, you know, okay, what's the pot of? Then you read it. Then you know what I'm talking about. Interesting. Is that how you're doing? Maybe. Well, I'm gonna push back on it, because I've got a group one, sir. The one who take the model off. Like, you don't have to have her on there in the first place, right? Like, if all we want is the words though. Yeah. You also want to put yourself in the place of that model, which is why a model is a model. Yeah. And then just, I really think you're very, really, which background is this? Are you successful at, whether it's not a model? Yeah. Just to write it. Yeah. Please. I want to creep down by the icon. Oh. Yeah. So why is she looking at me like that? I didn't do anything. Okay. I think that's right. Did anything you feel that way? Is a little creepy that they're just looking at you like this? Okay. I was like, because it's a hair product, like I like the way her eyes kind of like, this way, and it's kind of like my hair flowing, and it's kind of sexy. And also like, it makes me look at the product like, if it were part of my hair. I think it's kind of dry my attention this way. That's interesting. Or she was that other eye. I said, look a little bit. It might make me feel as creepy to me too. So I agree. Okay. So who's right? I think I've got target knowledge. Because for me or Zach, that's irrelevant. Which one? Okay. So let's talk about it. Sorry. I'm not even ready. Mary, how do you say that? Do we have not any red answer? Good. Good. You're taking it. There's a lot of stuff. So all the close in with females, they use more of this nicer, higher end products. It's a company. I'm going to just ask. How many of you like it? Eight times. Okay. Exactly. I'm a plugger. Okay. How many do you like pee? I feel split. Alright. So when you have a challenge like this, do you just go through that? Yes. No. If it's cold, I got five-go-leab dollars. I'm going to bet here. You're just going to say, my gut says this. Or should you potentially go do a little bit of marker research? Easy to be test. So this is what the power of some research can do. Let me show you this. There's some research we can actually do heat maps. It's really cool. You can actually show this online. You can see exactly what people look at. How long they look at it. What order they look at, it's really, really cool. And making it more cool. You can also do research where, while they're watching it, you also are diagnosing with AI. They're facial expressions. And you can see if you see something further out, it's just right instant. You can know exactly what they're looking at. Like maybe there's some confusion there. It's really cool. So these are the things, these are the tools and the methodology is at marker research. You can do it. So I have a heat map for you. Okay. Here it is. Wake up the red in your hair. Sun silk. Oh, look at that. Wake up the red in your hair. Oh, sun silk. Oh, sun silk. Then they went and they checked to look on buying tin. Guess which came out with hiring tin? See. I do have a clothing vest. Here we go. Eat it? You gotta get the monkey. There you go. Is that worth the investment? Yes. Why really bucks? We're now on the boat of the car. Maybe you have over 20 grand. Is it worth the 20 grand investment? So you know what you're doing to get a blue? We're going to get higher returns on. So that's going to make our line make sure it really proves it out. But this is the benefit of research. So gold light is great. But the goal is to be it, give you on the facts and really find the flies. This is why we do that. If we can find some facts that will fuel insight of future strategy, whether it be all these the merists, you find an aha about a consumer and why they do what they do. This is something that is really true for strategy. So did you feel back to the end and don't just look for facts, get to the flies. How many of you have done those research? Question there was a said, did you go to an event this weekend? Yes. How far did you travel for that event? Five times. Did you go alone or were you with someone? I was alone. Did you have a scale of one to ten? How did you feel about the, you know those types of questionnaires? How insightful are those? They're really not great. I mean you learn some interesting facts and make you do make some assumption based on those facts. But getting to a wide question is that's where it's really, really powerful. Okay, so let's now talk about the reason we have from last time. We didn't have time to talk about it. It's not about AI. As you started looking at market research, where's that happening to you right? Good. What were some of the aha's? What were some of the insights that you collected as you read this? How does it work? All of us, people started to know someone was talking about us. So they were like, oh yes. How would people think it's something like a thing that is shaggy? And everybody else could just go out and say, oh, that's so funny. Yeah. You know it's a bot that's interviewing? You're actually more honest. And for sure. Share more. I thought that was really interesting too. How many of you just as you were really guy excited about what this could be? Did you have to earn here? What do you think of this? You're talking about how it takes 20 grand to like, you know, three or three times. And this is going to take a lot of it. Yes. Yeah. Things will cost hundreds of thousand dollars now. So one of the ones that I saw lies in love. Remember when we talked about personal interviews? I'll tell you, if you go and do a personal interview, you've got to pay for that person. If you've got to pay for the person, if you're going to be limited by the hours of the day. So one person might be able to do 16 interviews. For a full day's work, that's going to cost you quite a bit. What can you do now with AI? I never bought that. That's just different questions. I don't know if you have the previous question. That's basically the idea. That's right. And how many interviews do you do at the same time? As many as you know. In fact, I was talking to, there's a, a big company called Atos over in Europe. I was talking to their CEO. He uses AI. He's used AI for the last two years when it comes to first-round interviews. And the bosses they use is his likeness, his voice. And he can now speak over 120 languages. Which is really cool. And he, that's how they do all their first-round interviews. How much of that save you? Is it on? Huge. Okay. What else do you have there? So I used to work for Atos. Yeah. And they started this process right after I was hired. And people like the outrage that people express to be interviewed by AI two years ago was like insane. Like people quit because of this. Really? I think it's very interesting. Are there risks associated with? Yeah. Tons. So let's talk about the risk. What were some of the things you article talked about? You have to be careful about that. For example, I can do these bias based off like research, what, how much does it matter? How do you work yourself? I might tell you these. Probably here, that might not be true. And I didn't see that like using the idea to actually have it. Can I tell you some interesting research that I heard about Friday? So Friday I had a chance to listen to professor who's actually doing some research in this area. And what he did is they used four different generative AI houses. They had so broad, and that you can see a bunch of different. And they put in the exact same problems. They did an A and E test. They said, I collected all the street shirts in the neighborhood. I think that there's an opportunity in these markets. And I've done, and this is what the probability looks like. And I give the probability. And then here's my buyer. And then they said, okay, would you invest in this opportunity? Really simple. Okay. The only thing that they changed was the profile of the person. The file that they put in, one of them was a little bit more progressive. So I believe it would be stuff like, I believe that it's really important as a business leader to be good at the environment. I believe. And you start, they just started including just a few hot lines that are used on one wing of this political spectrum. And then the other one, they used one. The other terminology was, that was it. It's like three kind of hues of what politics they might believe it. You would not believe how different the recommendations work from those different AI groups. Amazing. A and E testing, all they did was change it. You would think that the results, the recommendation would be the same. Is that fair? I mean, the only thing is maybe your perception on the environment. You would think that it would be okay. But the leader did not. It was a big swing depending on which box you used. And which house you used. Really interesting. Because the Zenith reading talks about the phenomenal confounding, right? Or that AI is using context that people wouldn't use because they're coming into a blind as a real human being. Because AI is built on the past, they won't make assumptions or change itself to match. Very good. Very good. Oh, it's not too. Any other insights you got? I thought that it would be a cool idea to take data and make more data. But you can have a better estimate of what the real market is saying. But we're definitely not there, right? Because data is like, like you said, it's not. It might not give you the best results. Because again, we're still working with people who are imperfect and make the machine go to perfect. Yeah, how did you like that? Like creating synthetic systems? Sometimes it's... We actually have somebody in the other section next week did that. But how many did that before you did that? Really interesting stuff. You just had a curiosity. If any of you listened or subscribed to a newsletter from Ethan Molleck, really recognize that name. Ethan Molleck, I recommend you subscribe to this channel. If you want to learn AI and how it's going to impact this guy's novel, reading Edge, is that him, or L-L-L-I-C-K? He's a warden professor. What did the other professors turn me to in probably about two years ago when a guy was just coming in? Because he was just so curious and so on top of me. He puts out a newsletter probably about once to twice a month. That's it, so we won't bombard you. But it's so insightful. And he gives you an understanding of all the different AI housings, the differences, what does next generation is like we're capable of doing. He shows you differences between the last generation and this generation, how much detail it is, it is phenomenal. In fact, we had the guy at Microsoft that was over all of AI for Microsoft. So, really senior level person. And when we asked him, who do you read? What do you do? He was all he does. So, the best of the best of utilizing this guy, if you want to, it's a really good source for you to stay on top of what's coming. Okay, so I recommend you do that. Any other comments on AI? Could please, yes, through it. I just really like, I wasn't trying to listen to Edict the AI. I was reading about duplicating people and making versions of them. And then, in my mind, you can ask AI questions that you can't actively ask somebody that's a real person. But you can kind of go past that barrier and get different responses. You wouldn't even ever be able to research people. And hopefully it might be, you might find some insight there. And I do all of that. I hope it's going to be a second. I hope this is something that's going to help you. There's definitely pros and cons, but the goal is to be able to come inside and help you be able to go forward. From an entrepreneur's side, I love what this is going to be able to do for business. I mean, the money you can save, the things you might not be able to afford to do to the business for more. Another year, it's going to be really going to be fun. I hope I did this. I'm going to come to AI. Trust it, but verify it. Well, I'll be reading what's said this about communist, about the Soviet Union, definitely. Trust them, maybe verify it. I would say the same thing about this when it comes to AI. Libergit, but make sure you know the sources from what to do for all. Whenever I use an AI for, I always ask for the primary research and primary sources. So why do you have an ability to make sure this is the truth? You don't want to be in business room and say, hey, why did you decide to do that lately? And lately says this is 80%. You don't want to do that. Have the source understand what's going to be to be able to make a better situation. I will share this. When we talk about the golden gut, there are some people that definitely have a golden gut. Steve Jobs hardly ever did any quant validation. Did some exploratory for sure that the man had an amazing gut? There's a lot of people in business that have amazing gut trusted. If you got a great gut, awesome, but verify it. Trust or verify it. So please be mindful of this. Now the other type of research is secondary research. You're talking about what that meant. You are very lucky to hear the Marion School. You have some amazing sources of wonder research that is free to you that cost industry hundreds of millions, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sometimes up to millions. If you want to learn how to do this, I'm not going to go over this, but just know in your slide, here's kind of the map on how to get to the Marion School's library, where you click, where you go. But there's some amazing websites like Nintendo and Ibus and a bunch of others. I used to use an industry that used to be a lot of money for me. Any category you want to learn about, you're not for more, average this. Really great. And you have someone here at the library, at the HBLL, that actually is dedicated to us here at the Marion School. Now, to answer your questions. So as you start doing research projects here at the Marion School, as you start doing consulting like in my class, please leverage this and leverage the talent of the library that you're worried about for some specific answers. Okay. Now today, we're going to talk about CKD data. I shared this with you because a lot of you, you're all here, day one. Nelson, let's be elsin. You look so optimistic, it's so fun. But then this weekend, I promise you, you'll feel like this. And if I gave it to you again in another week, you probably feel like this, and over time, you just learned to love it in any way since. How many of you actually have used Neil's censorship on a day of work? They said, where did you work? I worked at Sercona. Oh, you worked at Sercona? So yeah, for sure. Great product. Great product. I love it. In fact, do you give me Neil's censorship on a different level? But both of these are all big data sets. They collect the register rings, the grocery stores all around the nation, and then they take seconds of those and modern it so that you can be able to understand why your brand will run your product is the one you will do. Now today, we're going to dive into this. This is all about, do you learn that Neil's censorship on a deseggerated is all about peeling back the layers of the onion. You learn to strike because really no one over you got to peel back the layers. Same thing on what done it in business. You really don't want to know what done that you've got to ask the white questions. If not, you're going to have poor relations with others. So push yourself. So ask the questions you learned when you are in junior high, you're learning how to write for the first room. Make sure you get to the who, where, where, what, all in the pursuit of the point. And Neilson and Sercona help us to do this. So the spreadsheet that I gave you is a poll, an old poll, a Neilson. I've masked things that changed numbers, but it's directly very sound. Neilson is used as scorecard within organizations. It helps them understand what we're forming to you over the year. It will help them understand if there are ideas, or valid, or not. Help you understand if you're estimating or returning on investment actually occurred. So no one can want to do it again. And it can guide you in future decision making. And so Neilson is the second-day research. This big data is all there just for better choices going forward. What they'll do is they'll try to look at some different angles. On the manufacturer side, you want to understand how your company, your brand, your product, are performing. So let's have Coca-Cola. I understand how I'm performing, or I understand how my competition is performing. This is the tool that we'll help you see that. If I want to understand how micro-formance and business is, in certain retailers, this day is said will help me understand. I can know exactly what percentage my business comes from certain brands, or from certain retailers. You know what states? I can know our regions. It really gets to the location. So if I want to know how you're doing it, you can talk and it'll dismiss. This is the equivalent. It will also help me better understand my consumer. So we have Peter here. I want to learn more about Peter. I can't get to the specific Peter. But the CRM I can't but I can't on this. But if I wanted to find people that behave like Peter, and understand the segments that are like Peter, I can use that here. Now, it's a validating this day. They collect a sample of all of bunch of different stores. So they can have a representative sample. So I want you to think about every time you hear a beep at Walmart, and you hear something being registered, their CRM date is pulling all that information in. IRI and ECM also now go and purchase a segment like that. A representative is sent below that to make sure that they have a good thorough understanding of what that business is. How that business is important. They then send people out to the field to learn even more data. If I look at a registry, I can know what the product was sold at, what price was sold at, the location where was sold, and I can know the product. That was the right thing. I don't know anything else. So they actually have auditors that every week go to different retailers, which represent a sample, that might have happened in the store. They actually looked to see which products were sold on display. Which products on sale actually were just with a little yellow sticker tag right next to the normal place where they sell it. They also look and say, what's your instead of a retailer promote? And you have that information. Now, what did you a little bit more rigidly is, why some of them are just going to go on? So you've got mechanical rings coming through, you've got auditors going out to give us a little bit more color behind the purchase. Does that make sense? All right. So now, this is the beauty. Let's say you're running a business and you go in and you find out that your business is down. In fact, same period versus year ago, you're down one million cases. Okay? Versus year ago. How many of you are worried about your job if you see that? Yes. So this is a tool to help you understand where the volume went, why it went away, helps you have a couple of what done. It fills back to the layers. So it helps me understand performance. And on standards, the stuff that's going to be the right stir, this is how this product is really used. And it might still be the coverage of a million dollars. Now, to simplify it, I want to just kind of show you the key buckets here. You're going to look at when the downside of that performance here. What time? You're going to get down to the week if you want. Where did it happen? You can get down all the way to the retail or the region. Could it have happened to, if I'm looking at total co-consuming that my sales are down by a million, was it my entire brand or was it just diet code? So I can really narrow down, or was it one specific skew? It was the diet code with flavor with orange in there. Maybe that's what it is. So it's going to help me understand that. And then it's going to help me understand a lot of different measures. So to say it's like, what was the price that was purchased out? How was it promoted out of the shell? What was the distribution like at those retailers? It can help me understand all those different things. And once I collect this, now I can hope we get to the why. Things have gone down. Right? Okay, so let's simplify things. When you get into the spreadsheet, when you were looking at it, she said it was really hairy. Just a lot of data. Yeah, the network is dark. Yeah, there's so many cells. I mean, I apologize, but that's what it is. I want you to think about this from a consumer. I want you to simplify it in your mind. Okay? We're going to break this down and make it more simple for me. So let's say, I take a product that I purchased once a year. Right? You know this product? Okay, let's say for fun, I decided I used to first, I didn't bring my food storage along with me, and I'm really craving a power. And let's say I go to Jake here, and I hate Jake, we can be favorite. If I give you a dollar, we run down to B.C. and go grab one of these for me. They're usually that and that and that and that and that. So would you grab one for me? That's okay. And Jake should have actually built it up. So he comes back 20 minutes later and guess what? He didn't buy anything. He didn't buy anything. So why? What can I start to? Parapsych. I should have put my hair back in. Let's assume it was actually. Parapsych. I would have put it over the dollar. Yeah, you're right. What could have been? Parapsych. Good. Good, potentially been that. I wanted this blue power ring when he got there. There was no blue power ring. Would that stop you from buying? Okay, that's called distribution. So one of the things that will stop a normal person buying a product is the amount of distribution. That distribution? Yeah. Okay. Now there's type of, they were types of distribution. One of them is like, you went to the wrong retail. So maybe Walmart had it. He went to Macy's and Macy's didn't have it. Okay. So maybe that's it. Or maybe they're just not stopped. Given these even like that. Okay. That's store-as-� for some reason. Yeah, maybe the store was closed. That could have done it. What else could have done it? Brad Fee had to walk by like four fast food restaurants on the way there and just bought a whole ticket to Dollar. Jay, no self-control. Couldn't do it. He auctioned my dollar and bought a double cheeseburger or a single cheeseburger. Yeah. Because it was on sale. Okay, good. What else? The price is more than a dollar. Good. What happens with inflation? All of a sudden, what I thought was a dollar now it's a dollar ten. Is that going to stop you from buying it? Unless he's a really generous guy, which we know he's not. Okay. So that's something we could have done. Hey, what else? Maybe he would have realized that he didn't pay him for you service fees. Good luck. I just thought it was not even worth it. I just got to come back and show him. Yeah. There you go. Okay, any other reasons? Yeah. Two of a minute. All the way. Good. Good. Good. Didn't hazard a try. It's happened to you and Alfred. Good, Alex, what else? You know, maybe you got there and like, trying for a crazy. Okay, good. It was too busy. Did you kind of get a feel for it? This is the way we're going to break things down. We're going to look at it and say, okay, it's a regular price side and we pay it by why? Well, maybe it's distribution, maybe it's price. Those are two usually servings. Those are the key things that people don't buy things on the sale. Or on regular price. It's not available for its price or competition off of something different. Maybe it was a bad deal. Those are usually the three key things. So regular price. Those are three gold words. Makes sense? So if you find out that your business is down on regular price items, those are the three digital. Oh, okay. Makes sense. Okay, now let's flip it. How much do I buy power eight for on the fourth of July? Fifty cents. Fifty cents. So I give him a dollar. Is price getting any issue now? Hope not. But he comes back and he doesn't buy it. Why? Well, could have stopped him from buying it on sale. Some guy in the minivan took all the other ones. Some order. Yeah, we have all the blue car, right? Yeah, that could be what I should. Manually buy on the walker and not buy keys. Okay, good. That could have been others. Yeah. They move where it's to the beginning of the story. Good is a location again, maybe. Distribution, maybe. What else? What else could have stopped it? Yeah. You have to read this shaper and you want it to get the change. Okay, maybe. Yeah. What else did they decide to not offer on promotion that day? Last year they were able to buy a fifty cents, but this year wasn't on sale. When that impact your purchase. Yeah, for sure. Okay. We'd come up with this potentially clear. It's availability. How about this? What about the quality of the promotion that was associated with the discount? Let's say last year they advertised it heavily. And this year they didn't say a word. Do you think that might have impacted the performance of that discount? Same discount. The one that there's a lot of awareness building, one that's known. This is what this product does. Okay? So I'm going to teach you some of the terminology you're going to find in that spreadsheet. But keep in mind that it's basic things. Now, when you start breaking down volume. Could be dollar sales. Could be volume units. What you're going to do is you're going to bring the first question you asked in your decision tree. In your mind? What you asked. Is it base promotion or base volume or incremental volume? Base means this volume is typically what we always sell. It's usually the regular price. Not always, but typically it's regular price. Is that where the copper was? Was it the inflation? Or was it on the incremental side? Was it during the fourth of July weekend? Which one? Which one's the biggest culprit of where that volume is going? That's the first question you asked. Now, if you add up base and incremental together, you're going to find that that equals total volume. Okay? So, the first thing I'm going to do is ask this. Is it base volume or is it incremental volume? Am I finding this on sale or regular price? Now, that's not the exact definition. I'll explain that in a minute. From there, I'm going to break down the base volume. What other things are you going to stop base volume? You talked about them. What are they? Distribution. Distribution and? Price. That's not the definition. Okay, good. So, I'm going to look at, is it distribution? And there's a couple of different types we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about something called total points of distribution or average number of items. And another one called ACD. Is it acronym for all commodity volume? And I'll explain that to you. Okay? So, is it that or? Is it the velocity? How fast it turns? And that's usually based off of the economics. And the price goes up. What happens to the velocity? It goes down. So, the thing, so ACD, again, that's a breadth of distribution. Okay? Another type of distribution. I told you is ANI or TDPs. Those are the depth of distribution. Again, I don't know what it was in there. Or the velocity is the price changing. Or is there competitive activity? Okay? If you get it down to that simple way, that's going to help you understand why the normal products that normally move in a certain way aren't moving. Okay? So, would you look at that gigantic spreadsheet? Yeah. Would you look at that spreadsheet? Look for this, okay, the shend face. Now, incremental volume. One of the things you could stop you from buying on sale items. What are they? Okay, distribution again? Is it on sale or is it not on sale? Awareness? Competitors? Would you do more here? So, if we're going to incremental, I'm going to look at the quantity of support. What that means is, the number of weeks it was offered on sale. So, if I'm looking at all the month of July for powerings performance, and last year there were two weeks, and this year there was one week of sale, that will dramatically impact your incremental volume. Okay? That's when we first got quantity. The quantity of days, the quantity of weeks it's on sale. The other way is the quality of that will say it. All of these have a discount. And so, now we're going to look and say, what's the price different? It was last year, it discounted at 20% and this year only 10%. That will impact the quantity of incremental dollars. Okay? There you go. There's the promo price of prices. The other thing that you can do is you look at competitive activity as well. Okay? There's something going on there. Okay? Now, this quality, we talk about the promo mix. There are different, remember what we talked about that maybe, how well would your on sale item go, move, if you had a big ad campaign to support it? Remember that? That goes to the promo mix. So, if you have a display, for example, a secondary location to sell your product that's short-term, you're going to get a boost. Remember when we talked about pot pies the other day? And I told you, they told me we're going to give you an end gap. That would be a display. If I have a display, and have a discount, is that going to give you more volume than if I don't have a display, and have a discount? Okay. So, display is one that we've already said. There's another one called a TPR. That's an afternoon called the temporary price reduction. TPR is temporary price reduction. Now, all these things have a discount. Display has a discount, and it's represented in a secondary location. TPR, it's just the discount, that's it. It's a temporary price reduction without any support behind it. So, in other words, have you ever gone to the store, you go to buy your milk, and you're like, oh, sweet, it's on sale. Didn't even know it was on sale. Sweet. That's what it is. It's just a price that's given right on the shelf. It wasn't advertised. You'll still sell more and more likely, but that's what we call a TPR. No extra support behind that. The feature is now being added with communication. So, those little newspapers that you see, you walk people and you walk into the store, or if you go to their main website, and you see what's on sale, those are usually referred to as pictures. Okay. If you're advertising it, you're telling your parents or you that there's a big sale on Lucky Charms this year, or this week, odds are you going in to buy Lucky Charms with these hands. Does it make sense? Now, the highest quality is when you merge feature and display. You can tell people and you can send their luggage. That's the highest quality. Okay. Here we follow that. All right. Now, listen a little bit of quiz. So, TPR is again just a discount, but here's something that's really interesting. I told you earlier, if I look at total volume, okay, and if I add a base, and I add up incremental volume, those equal total volume, right? In your data set, you're also going to see two other words. One's called non-fulfillment volume. And one is called promoted volume. Okay. And guess what those equal? Yeah, those are. Yeah, to this. But here's the crazy thing. This is the thing that's going to confuse you. This does not equal this. And that does not equal that. And this is why. This is one of the reason why. Base volume is what you typically get over time. But I thought that's kind of the regular price, right? Have you ever been, do any of you know a product that it always says it's like $1.49, but you always know you can buy it for $0.99. Like that's just the real price. Like chips are a lot like that. So does our lot like that. It always says that you can buy a six pack for $0.99, but almost always there's a discount. So should we? Thanks, Ed? When I ran the bank with business, we always sold it for $1.29 per meal, but we never sold it for $1.29 per meal. It was always $0.99. Now here's the rule. When you have a discount on an item for seven consecutive weeks, right here, that becomes what they call the new base price. Is that really what the base movement is? So there are going to be times where if I offer it a bank with my base or my non-promoted price, it is $1.29. My promoted price is $1. Makes sense? But my base price is also a dollar because I keep that on sale in your record. So this is where you get the discrepancy. Does that make sense? Yeah, please. What is your scenario that's maybe not base? It's base price, but it's like a limited edition item. Or something like that. It's like maybe so you can't, but you can't. Yeah. I'm pretty sorry for the reduced price. I mean, the original one is like a limited edition item. Usually, you always tie it to a price. Okay? So if you have, let's say you've done something like a movie pack or a re-appercising movie, if it's the regular soda at the regular price, even though it has a movie pack on it, it'll still be on its base. Makes sense? Ask the people with that. Okay? So I'll show you a couple of things. All right, yeah, please. If you've got a constant discount, but it's slowly in terms of all value on it, so like woodmakers, right? You always have heard all of the money that you might have promoting those $2.50. Yeah. Are you calling it base model, kind of the highest price of the internet? They usually look to see if you go back today. So if I went six weeks and went back to my normal price, and then I went down again, my base price would remain the same. That's the seven street weeks. If I go $1.29 down to $1 for six weeks, and then I go for $1.5, it's still a document. Makes sense? Yeah. So, yes, please. I don't want to disturb it. No, it's the same thing. I was just thinking about the concept. You brought a movie, and they did it like five-dollar two-set. Yeah? I'm curious how that would, because it's ongoing, but it becomes only under two-day price. That would just be a promoted price. They usually do it over time. They're about to look at specific days. Does that make sense? Yeah. Even though two-day, that's typical more, but on Wednesday, if there's Friday, it's not. Okay. So it goes back to normal. Yeah, please. Where does the seven-weeks come from? Like is this, like, a very, very continued movie? Or like, now I'm in T-Shirt here, because I've seen it. So you know those store audits, like told you about, or people actually go to the stores. That's where they're going to check. All right. Does this help? Everybody? Okay. So as you look at this, now here's the challenge. When you get into the data, there's no base display, but there is promoted. Okay. So when you look at this, do you remember they're correlated, but they're not the same. You can still read in the things, if you see something is not promoted, or promoted in a special price, you can first things about incremental. Does that make sense? It may not be perfect, but you can infer what's going on in the category. Okay. We'll use that direction. All right. So let's look at this. Here's a real example. Here is SpaghettiOs, everybody food. Here is Chef Weardine! Everybody food! Okay. So here's Chef Weardine. Here's SpaghettiOs, being promoted. Look at this. $1.79. That's a new low price. So $1.59. Let's say it's been eight week eight. What is the biggest price? Good. What is the incremental price? $1.50. You see that? So this right here, is the non-commoded price. This right here is the base price. And this right here is the promoted price. Makes sense? That's pretty interesting. What would it be sub-seven weeks? sub-seven weeks would be just the beginning of it. It would be the promoted price. Wait. What would be basically? Basically the entire price. What's the beginning? Oh, it made the same. And you just have two deals. One will lower it. One will lower the price. Exactly. So you got to slow this down if you want to. And that's it. Okay. Yeah, please. Something I like these times, these types of tags at the store. And I was just, sometimes you'll see them. It's two for three. We have to buy two. Sometimes it's two for three. It doesn't matter. You might want to work two in the prices one for five days. Do we care about that for this data? In terms of like the seven weeks? Or is it? They will be monitored during that. Still. So yes, they always care about that. And it just depends on how long that that deals can last. So if it goes for seven weeks and you have to buy three, then they're going to look at it. If it doesn't, and they're going to look at it. Does that make sense? So just the fans will know how. Yeah. If they do it for seven weeks base, if they don't, it would be the new. So if you had to buy two in this example, then it still would be the new base. One more. Yeah. If it's been seven weeks, like is the none promoted volume of almost anything always like zero? Or whatever? Because you can't even buy it at what seven weeks you can try. I guess that's pretty fair. Well, see, that's where base comes in. Because base, it'll tell you what's there all the time. And that's what I said. It's almost always tied to price. But if you have a base volume, you're getting a hundred thousand units every week over time. And if it kind of shifts on that price, but you're still getting the hundred thousand volume, that's kind of the base. Now the promoted, not promoted, then you'll stir, see, okay? Okay. All right. So this right here is going to be what? It is. Very good. This one? No, very bad. Okay, promote it. All right. Now, display. Display means the volume. It has to be temporary. Push the volume. It gets a temporary, secondary location. Now, you can have two locations that are not temporary. That's okay. That's not secondary display. Think about barriers or candy. You usually have a place in the aisle for candy and at the checkout stand. Just because you have two locations does it and you have a secondary display. All right. So we thought through about that. So the other one is that you also want to make sure that it's a special effort by the retailer to promote this brand in some way. And you got to make sure to purchase it in the bill. So, let's look at this. Here is a Cincinnati Red. This is in a Cobra over in Cincinnati. Here is a Cincinnati Red, Coke and Diet Coke display. Okay. Is that a display? Yes. Is that what is normally there? More likely not. Okay. You look at this right here, battery center. Is that a secondary display? No. You can think of this as a depends. Depends on whether it's on the watches in the regular aisles and whether it's temporary or it's temporary. That's it. Makes sense? So you'll again simply like candy. You might have a battery center and you might have some things that are ordered by the registered. But if it's new, we're sure tied, then it'll be counted. Good pace for that. Sense it out of your eyes. It's a good question. Can we table that? We start talking about channel. We're going to start talking about something called trade. Oh, it's mine. Okay. What about this right here? Secondary display? No. This is a company just trying to get rid of stock. That's what I'm like. Okay. So that would be what this would be. Okay. Now feature. We'll talk a little bit about feature. These are newspaper, circulations, or pliers. There's also a product called an FSI. FSI is an acronym in business that we call free standing inserts. Free standing inserts. This is a coupon that's sent by the manufacturer without any regard to retail. We're generally going to include these in this. Okay. So this right here is a circular from a store. That would be considered a feature. If you walk into the grocery stores, you walk in CDs. Right. This is an FSI. We've seen these before. Where they have an ad and then you have a coupon on your clip. Those are not included in this. It's a hard to trap. Okay. So don't include that. That'll just be a part of your base one. So it would not be. Now, the next thing we're going to talk about is distribution. I'm going to have to do this quickly. ACD measures the breadth of distribution of where your product is available. Okay. So it's going to look at more from a retailer perspective and say, okay, on all the dollars that are spent in this category, let's say, let's say I decided I'm going to sell B-way cream. If I went out to hear a crowbone, I said, okay, Walmart typically an ice cream sales. That's $15 million in business. Okay. That's one retailer. Are there other retailers here's crowbone? Yes. There's three of them. Smiths. There's one. Smiths. They usually get about $10 million and then the other big ones like Harley's. And then there's some other bonds and bonds. Now, distribution is not saying I got all three of these. Therefore, I have a hundred percent distribution. No. What they do is they say, what is a representative volume that people typically buy in the spots? So if I just get Walmart, okay. So the market, if you add all this up, is worth $30 million. If I just get Walmart, what percentage is 15 of thirds? 15 percent. I just earned 50 percent as you. So my product is available half of the consumers where they typically buy their ice cream. Does that make sense? How did you use that? That's like a sentence. Like, what do you think you would Walmart like in that sentence? So if I were to go out and say, hey, look, I've got an 85 percent as me. What that means to me is if I look at all the United States, the consumers where they buy my product, 85 percent of the stores sell that product. They have access. Does that make sense? It talks about the breadth of distribution. Okay. Now, I know that's a little tricky. Don't sweat it. It's great. Just remember that. Now, you can start getting into average number of items and total points of distribution. Now we're talking about the debt. So let's say you've got a product that's 95 percent as you use. Where the product is sold, 95 percent area, you've got it. That's really good. Flavor of two, 90 percent of all stores do. Number three, 80 percent. Number four, 30 percent. If I have a little doubt that comes to you, cumulative distribution goes up to three, up to 95. Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look and say, okay, let's look at that house with my breadth. Now, let's go and let's look and see what my debt. There's a measure called ANI or average number of items or total points of distribution. If you see that your product has 3,431 total points of distribution, that means the number of brands, number of products, and that brand that you have. Okay. In other words, that means that Tide has 35.4 skews on average across the American shelves. They have a 97 percent ECM. So, a 97 percent of all of the cases is someone in the field. All has 91 percent ECM. That's really good, right? 90 percent, but lower, but still really solid. Look at the difference. The average is 10 items on shelf. We just going to have a much bigger business. So, if you introduce a new product to motivation, the goal, hopefully you already have the ACV, the goal is to get the average number of items on shelf. Get incremental growth there. Does that make sense? So, if I don't see that blue data rate, and I'm trying to figure out what then it will maybe be the disney-chini of one of my average number of items. I'm still, I still have the region maces. It's still there, but I may not have the bride. Does that make sense? Okay. So, folks, I get it. I know this is like a fire hose. Please, dive into it and burn together. You're going to have many opportunities to continue to master this over the next few days. If you have questions, don't hesitate to reach out. The whole group is still processing. You never stay out of the room. What the whole group is making is still working. Great discussion, Senna. I'm going to say something."
