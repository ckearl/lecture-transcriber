  "text": "What are a couple of frameworks so we introduced in this class which you now can understand if you're going deep enough. What's one of them? Spot is one. Spot is one. That's something we can rather do after we do that. See, what's something we have to do before the swap? The PC. Good. The easy 7s. That's a great framework to make sure you're looking holistically at C-100. What's another one that helps me understand my portfolio and how to best coordinate it? The PCG growth. Good. Make sure you're again, you become comfortable growth and know how to do life skills. So we've learned about the four C's. Remember when we take C-consumer which we're going to dive in today and that is going to be the bridge for the beginning of our pool or what is in our half. So we're going to dive into that and then we get into the four P's. Last time we talked about multi-interno and making sure that before we start making these strategic decisions we seek first to understand ourselves. And to do so we introduce you to the kids of 7s and ask you to introduce your growth matrix. We also introduce you to a very important document. Those that are going to have a profit loss statement. And marketing, you've got to understand the profit loss statement. Every choice you make impacts that document. That's why you own it. And so please be thoughtful. Now we also talked about the importance of liking things to ourselves. What do we like in our brand P&L to personal? Family budget. Good old family budget. And as we talked about these are so strongly correlated. If you really want to be able to break down your brand P&L remember the top line is always growth. That's on revenue and on profit. Growth profit, a lot like our salary. To be a good and honorable citizen in America we pay taxes. To be a good and honorable citizen in industry we pay. Trade. Trade. We talked about different types of trade. What did you talk to trade? We talked about in Christ. What's laudity? What's laudity? It's a kind of a game of play. It's like general admission to get on the shelf. Right? What's the average cost to pay the play to get 100% ACB across the US? 1.75 million dollars for one skew. Good. What's the other type of trade? That's good. Now we're going to discount the product to help the retailers attract new consumers and help us strategically out-compete our politicians. Let's just talk about those couple of those buttons. Once we have that we take home what's in our net. It's like our take home baby now. This is what we really make. We give it discounts. We pay the play. Now this is in our net. Now we start paying our bills. In our world we call it cost of living. In the brand world we call it. Cost of goods sold. Good. Anything that goes into making your product and distributing it. Getting it to the retailer is there. So warehouse and fuels, transportation, all those things are going to be taken out of cost of goods. When you're done now you have your first top line gross number. Now we're talking about profit on margin. If you're smart what do you do with some of that money? You invest in the future. We invest in marketing through what? App raising. Ads. Promotion and research. The more we understand the better future strategy we can make. So that's an investment in the future. We get done with that. Now we can contribute what we have left over to the corporation to start paying their bills. This is the contribution margin. Now we also talked about a couple of key measures that Wall Street looks at to make sure that they understand the health of our business. Remember two of them? The two that we discussed work two percent of the week. Gross margin percentage. What does gross margin percentage mean? Gross margin percentage. It's gross margin divided by net sales. In other words, of all the money that you took home with you. All the money you made, what percentage you get from it? That's all we're saying. All right? What's the other percentage? It's not a country. If you see M percentage or product contribution margin percentage. And that represents all the money that we made, even after our investments. This is what we get from it. So two good, pretty basic overviews of what Wall Street will be looking at. So don't forget, we always, always, always divide by net sales. On our brand or on our product, product P&Ls, always. Because that's the money we actually made. All right? We didn't make gross because we gave discounts and after that. So don't divide by gross sales. Right? And the PCM, same type of equation. It's new readers, your contribution margin. Then you go into sales. All right? Okay. Now, today, I thought we'd start with a little bit of practice. Should we start applying what we learned? Okay. Let's see if you can do this. Now, we give you a chance. And by all of you, see if you can do it too. Okay? Here's what we're going to do. I want you to divide up the two and three. And let's do a little bit. So let's say you're a gentleman by the name of John Downhill. Okay? Let's introduce Gag and John, who is learning how to ace marketing on 15. So he writes a book. How to get an A in marketing by 15. Okay? So he decides to sell his book at Barnes & Noble for $10 each. And based off of this forecast, he had just been selling $2 million copies. That's not a good job. That's great. All right. Okay. So now, the cost of getting his book into Barnes & Noble is $1.5 million. All right? The cost of printing the paperbook book is 40% of gross sales. And there's an extra warehouse in the feed. You'll need to account for it. You then they stuff the future. That's a little bit advertising. That's a little bit in market research. So what I like you to do is I'd like you to want to do a Lightroom sell. Whatever you need to do. That's to recreate this P&L. And I like you to go with the gross market percentage. And the E-Sync percentage. Okay? Mark said go. Go for it. All right. It's actually a lot. It's a lot of gross sales. I'm showing up paper.

I think that was a small one. Yeah. You're a big bird. Yeah, keep going. I think you need one more minute. Yeah, you need one more minute. One more minute. One more minute. Yeah, you go one more minute. One more minute. How's yourAJ? Oh. Just one thing, one thing. ission Destroy, Who can handle our�. Okay, alright. I just wanna ask you, if that says something. Can we name the characters? Yeah. I think it's a drop-and-down. I don't know. You're actually a big deal. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. I'm trying to get you back. It's fine. It's fine. it's fine, baby. And you just have the before you are... You just have our houseéchelle. It's fine, baby. You just have our houseéchelle. I'm just going to say that to you. That's what I'm saying. Let me ask. Hey, what's the cat that has to be with us? Is that the human? The human, the human, the human, the cat that has to be with us. Is that the human? That's the human. That's the human. Yeah. So what's the human? The human. No, it's the human. It's like the human. Right. Right. Like on their bond. That's the human. The human's sureity is what's the argument. It's like the human. Okay. All right. Let's go through JD's P&L. Here, you all ready? Okay. Let's go through his P&L and let's figure out how he's doing from a business perspective. First off, how healthy is this P&L? Good. Not too shabby. It's both us. Okay. So let's go through and let's just see how we did it. Okay. So in order to get through all sales, what do we need to combine? We've got to figure out the number of units we sell times the price. When I do that, what do we get? $20 million. So John F. N.O. goes to his $20 million. Now, it's a good, not-able citizen to type the trade. What are they? Lighting in. What are we getting in this case? Lighting in. How much? $20 million. $20 million. I take that out. No other discounts happening here. So there's no more trades. So therefore, our net sales is $18.5. Very good. Okay. Now we've got to start taking out the cost of goods. Now, cost of goods is 40% of what number are on this? Grows. Grows. Grows. Grows. Grows. Grows. Grows. Grows. Grows. We've got to buy costs. The 1 million for the warehouse team. That takes me down $9 million. Which is the 9.35. I'm going to get that right. We've got a pretty straightforward. Now, he's smart. JD, what did you invest? Advertising and research. I'm just going to put it in overall. It takes me 6 million overall. Good. So 5 million for AMP. 1 million for market research. Game market research. Not a cost of goods. This is something we do for future strategic growth. So that's why we put it down. We'll take that out. Now we're going to 3.5. So when I look at gross margin percentage, what do we have? Okay. Go plus 50. Then when we look at on the PCM side. 18. 18. Okay. So that's what we got. How many of you got that? Look at that. Well done. If you missed it, you see why. Okay. Easy to take in the state. Just keep on doing this. I'll tell you folks, you're going to see if you have a question about the measure of quiz. If you're going to have this, you're going to do fine. Just make sure you ride it out. Sometimes you'll think things intuitively. You don't double check your numbers. Make sure you really can follow it closely. You can do it too. Yes, please. If this works, slotting and catch this counts instead, what information will we give? So you can say I could have said something like, JD decides to offer a 10% discount to reduce the price of the book from $9.99 to $8.99. So what would that be? You say, okay, he's giving me a dollar discount. You're going to sell how many units? Go and supply those together. Take that out. Great. Does that make sense? Okay. Any other questions on this? Again, pretty straightforward. If any of you get really excited and like doing this and if you don't want to advance brand management, that's going to be a lot of fun. Part of it gets to do that today. So anyway, that's what we're going to be doing. Now, the other key measure is going to be really important for all of us. There's a lot of them. But what other key things you've got to understand is return on investment. Return on investment. And then you play thorough eyes with the board. Good. Just layman's turn. What does this mean? Layman's turn. So I'll just sell it. That's what I'm going to have to do. All of that, that's what I'm going to have to do. My clip art, misspelled investment. I didn't even notice that. That's pretty bad. It's not high this. It's even at best. They can't match that. Sorry about that. Okay. So in layman's turn, what does this mean? Yeah, please. You can get an effect. Good. You put in some money, would you get back for it? That's really what it comes to. It's really, really simple. So let's say, let's go back to this, this little big case that we just said, Jay. So let's say Jay decides that he's going to invest $5 million into some advertising. Okay. When he does that, his business increases by $10 million. Okay. Does that make sense? So, gain would be what? $10 million. $10 million, investment spend would be $5 million. Divide that by five. What would we get? $2. What is it? $100%. Is that right? $200. Is that right? Yes. That's a people looking like, I'm sure. Make sure. Does that make sense? Now, why is ROI so important in business? What does it help us do? Please minimize opportunity cost. Okay. Good. Now, when you say opportunity costs, this is really, really broad. Am I going to be looking at ROI comparing just anything? Am I going to keep it a little bit more narrow? Because your life is like, life is white. You got to compare Apple and Apple. It's not Apple. It's good. No, I think that's fair. So, I mean, think about it. Let's say you historically been investing in advertising. And you want to be able to understand if you want to continue doing that versus another promotional opportunity. Versus maybe another innovation opportunity. Versus maybe more slotting, more investment there. Having something like this enables us to be able to say, okay, realistically, especially comparing Apple's apples, which one is going to be a better choice? You know, is ROI the end all beyond what gets selected? Some of you are shaking your head and know why. Why do we look beyond ROI? Sometimes you want to be strategic about what markets are trying to say. Right? You might have a real ROI on. That's why you're trying to be a higher-up, so you're not going to be able to say exactly what you're trying to say. But the 27% of the sales are going to be a bit too much. That's a way that you're going to be able to do it. Very good. That's it. So, sometimes, if you go in there and you look at your return on your investments, there are some times that our going to have a payout is going to be immediately. It isn't going to be immediately. And so you have to look at the long-term perspective. I'll tell you, for me, in individuality, individuality, when in our brands, we would never look at an ROI when it came to television advertisements. We never would, because it would never pass for a few years. We'd also look at a two or three-year return to national, and you'd really start seeing that we pay off more. So, be thoughtful with that. Sometimes, you'll invest in things that strategically might grow your business. You just may not get the immediate return. How do you manage your own investment? You really have to make sure... Well, you guys started getting into, like, the rush of analysis. Those things, yeah. You will. There's an analytic composing. You can try to isolate what's driving your business over time. Takes a lot of... Takes some time, some effort, but you can try to isolate as much as you can to see if it's going to be so easy. So, for example, let's say that you're trying to make a decision on... Do I invest in that opportunity that goes to this segment of the market, or this segment of the market, or this segment? You've got three completely different segments. Let's see, once B and B, business, once B to C, and once just internal improvements, internal organizations. Going over and checking up a long-term period, which one's going to help through your growth, looking at those numbers and isolating them there, hoping to sideways with your own issues. All right, so you get a good ballpark on this. All right, now, in your reading last time, we need to get a chance to talk about it, because we spent some of the time diving into the PNL. Remember that when you as individual start... Start explaining your PNL to offer management. You have to make sure that they care. Okay? What's going to help them care? What did your reading to teach you? What's going to help them get pleased? You have connected to those overall business goals. Other might be not using the values of playing marketing, but they are put in budget here, and then you're marketing. So you have connected to the words the company's moving that are large-scale-based, and that's how they will see that the importance of putting more into that money. Good, love that. So what she just said is we have to hear our four C's. We have to understand C company. If we understand C company, and we understand the objectives and the goals that we've laid out, they're more likely to be more excited to see how this helps them achieve those goals. Perfectly, thank you. What's another word? What else did you learn that reading? Yes, please. How are you working your own chip with the CFO? That is a good thing. Why is that important? The CFO is very interested in finding this stuff out and answering in. Justifying things and explaining things that you have to do. Good. So if you want to talk to that CFO, because you're so worried about the monies that are going to... She'll shout out. What's a good thing that you can talk to him or her about? ROI. Okay, it helps bring that members to something that they care about. So please, when you go in, when you start making your pitch for investments, when you go in, you're starting to make arguments for the financials that you assume you're going to be able to get your bonuses going to be tied to them. Make sure you're talking to their language. Make sure they understand their goals and their objectives. It's a great article. I hope all of you will understand that in one more time. Just review it. Is it going to make a difference of whether or not you're successful in selling it? Okay. All right. We've learned that we must know ourselves. All right? Sometimes, when we ignore looking at this, we make some mistake. I saw some of this commercial that reminded me a lot of this challenge. Here we go. It's not working. You can tie, you might hold this. It should work. Okay. Is that what you're going to do? Okay, here we go. Find your blind spot. Find job that easy. Hide big things. You're good. You can get paid for this yourself. All right. So I was super glad talking about it. Sure. Sorry about that. Are there times where we as corporations have blind spots and we're unaware of those blind spots, we make full of strategy. Do you remember that? All the time. How many of your corporations have made this foolish decision to do that? Almost all have done this. And so understanding our blind spots are really, really important. So before we move forward, I just want to make sure you're your your talk to about a few common areas that we develop blind spots and corporations. And give you a couple examples of that. So first, what are the key things that we have to do is we make in-dial assumptions? We assume, market research that we learned about 10 years ago is still valid. It may not be. At least we're angry ourselves as some facts at our own, something we've actually covered. But if we're not careful, we might be able to start assuming the things that we're teaching. Or assuming the things that we're asking for aren't still right. One of my bosses that I had was probably one of the best of this. I remember him coming to me and he- we're looking at our P&L. We're trying to figure out how we can reduce our cost of goods sold. And one of the ideas was to change our packaging. And so I kind of stopped and I said, I said, we can't change the packaging. This is a kid-focused product. And it's a key equity drive. We changed this part of our packaging. This is something we're known for. It's not going to go well with this. And he just stopped and he goes, okay. That might be true. How's that research? And I stopped and I don't know. And he said, do you think we ought to know that? Yes. And sure enough, it was 15 years old. You know what I had ever questioned this before? Because the story we found out that that was true. Can consumers change their mind at 15 years? Especially when you're working with kids, where you haven't been for only four years. I've got four generations of kids during that same time. Are they still the same? So question. Luckily we went and we validated it in the still truth. But at least we knew. So make sure that you challenge some of the sacred cows, some of the sacred facts that people anchor themselves to. Compact for a while in computers. They often said technology always beats price. But then you had competition coming in saying, oh no. Price can be technology. As long as we can fit that job to be done, at a less expensive price, we're good. Second one is the winter's current. Sometimes we overestimate the value of the item. We paint too much. One of the cases that we're going to be reviewing in a couple of weeks is going to be on conagraph foods. And when you get into conagraph, you're going to find a company that built their business over 20 years in corporate acquisition. They lived in Omaha, home of birch hour, half way and water buffet. We just kind of collected companies like trading cards. They did the same thing. They went out and they bought my 91 independent operating companies. And just killed it in the market. It was really, really well. Well they stopped after a while and then started growing internally. And then about 15 years later they started doing it again. No one could still have those expertise. But they did not have that expertise anymore. And Wall Street killed them for some of the foolish decisions that they made. So be mindful. Another one. Sometimes we get stuck in what we call an escalating commitment. You've all heard the sunk cost fallacy. Continue investments in bad ideas. Then if you ever guilty in this, if I just do this, one word that I do to serve my car. If you've done that, if I just changed the brakes, I should be good for a while. That's my way. It shouldn't be good. And then I'll pay that in about six months. If I just replace this AC unit, it will be good. And it will be hold members and everything. So I just continue invest in 11. It's not the best strategy. Sometimes you need to be very thoughtful about that. Corporate ideas too. Another thing. Overconfidence. Sometimes we believe that we are smarter than what we are. We anchor ourselves toward gut. Our golden gut, we talked a little bit about that when we talked more of research. Are we angry with the golden guts and guesstments? Be careful with that. Sometimes, because we want to be quick, we'll skip important research or we'll make rationalization. It's good to have a good gut, but it's even better when you can verify it if the cost of being wrong could be detrimental to your population. Another one is we only seek out the information that validates our assumptions and our ideas. Please, don't get stuck in confirmation bias. Don't always just go agree to agree. We don't contention over the devil, right? But doing wrong things, doing wrong things. So let's make sure that we don't just agree to agree. The other thing is sometimes we think that if we build it, people will come. A lot of big brands make this mistake. Be thoughtful about that. And why is it your investment? It's just because you can successful in launching a new phone year over and year over, your investment year is going to be as successful the next year. Just because you build it doesn't mean that they will always fall. Just to show you a couple examples. All of you remember Sears when you were young? Okay. Now, I will tell you when I was getting my MBA, Sears was the Walmart of our time. Sears was the big dog. That was one of the most indeed retail management positions in our MBA school. Now Sears had a little bit of golden gut issue. And I want you to show you some of their sacred cows from the Indian Valley sections of day-to-day and how Walmart challenged it. It was very successful. So the rule of thumb with Sears used to be the large cities where the place where you did the largest droughts. That's where the investment was. We were worried about our time going to the small towns. We're going to go on the big towns because we're going to fish with a fish arc. Okay. The Walmart proved that to be a drier box. Oh, awesome. Walmart said, let's just focus on the cities. We're going to get to K. We can focus on 50,000. We will actually get really low. And they did. Sears said, hey, we're going to put a nice investment in these new stores and then we're going to treat them like a cash cow. We're not going to invest a lot in them. Once they've launched, people will come. Walmart, very different. How many of you have been in a Walmart that's been refurbished? That they've redone it. Yes. Walmart is continually looking to improve the shopping experience for their customers. So they actually invest heavily in stores, both new and old, trying to make sure that they're always improving the shopping experience. Sears did not do that. Sears had a very weak distribution system. They didn't spend a lot of money in this area. And because of that, they were frequent stock guys. Walmart, how much do they spend in their operations? Hundreds of millions. This is one of their core competencies. They are so good at this. It's given them such a huge strategic advantage. So they invest heavily in this. They don't just assume you haven't got them once. They're always going to come back and monitor the light. And they know that it's the product. If you want a sale product, it's got to be on sale. Sears, as it had to recognize their store staff, was to visualize people didn't love working there. Walmart symbolically is always looking internal promotions. At Walmart, it doesn't matter what your rate is. On Saturday morning, that's when everybody gets their rally. And it doesn't matter if you're a VP or if you're a manager of the store. On Saturday mornings, we're together, unity. Sears, additive velocity, separate management staff, Walmart, treat all the places partner. Again, when we look at ourselves, and if we challenge some of these sacred cows, hopefully a leader needs a long, two or six steps. Now, before we move forward, the last thing I want to talk about on C Company, are some of the strategic things that we need to make sure that we evaluate before making our choices. So we see first step understand on that first four, C's, right? On C Company, please, don't move down to who, what, how? Don't move down until you've answered the following questions. The first one. Make sure you before you make your decisions, you know what frame you should be looking at. We call this the fundamental entity. Through what lens are you looking at the business? And do you really understand your business well enough to know what business you really in? I'll describe this in a second. The other thing is we look at is we look for anything internally that offers us a stable or strategic competitive advantage. Yeah, this is specifically in C Company. Yes, this is what it means. S.E.A.'s internally. Do you have skills that you outperform others? There are some stupid ways that you can potentially offer to help you in long term. And then the last one is please don't start firing before you know what success looks like. It's ready aimed to fire, not fire ready to. So do you understand the goals? The corporate goals do you understand what the management is trying to accomplish? It seems really simple. Let me explain just a little bit more. So fundamental entity is two questions. One, through what lens are we looking through? So for example, let's say you're the brand manager and you're over double stuff Oreo. Okay? You need double stuff fans and you're great product. Okay? Okay, so you got double stuff Oreos. Man, you're... Do you look at your business lens that you're putting together? Do you put a strategy together only through the lens of double stuff or should you also consider how your strategy is getting impact the greater Oreo brand? Is that the framework you really should be looking for? Or should you even step a little bit further back and include everything in the nebisco portfolio in which Oreo lives? Do you think about Ritz? Do you think about Shigida and Miske? Do you think about any of those? Or do you also look at all of what Monulees offers? Do you consider the implications for their chocolate categories? They're sweet categories. They're healthy snack categories. Are you considering all of those? Now, will this lens that we're looking through impact our strategy choices? If I go here versus here, which is going to be probably more aggressive? Probably here, right? If I decide that I'm going to go all out and be a super competitive, I'll probably start here. And that's where a lot of brand managers, product managers, that's the lens in which you look. Usually, these two. You're looking at your brand and your current brand. But not much from on that, because they want you to make sure that you're going to be aggressive. They want you to be able to say, hey, look, I'm not going to worry so much about Ritz. I'm going to do what is right for my category and my snack. That's it. But I'm also going to be mindful that I'm not undercutting Oreo and it's pricing. I'm not going to price double-stop lower than regular Oreo. I'm going to be least thoughtful from that perspective. Does that make sense? Okay, so make sure you understand what great work you're looking at. Now, your bosses are going to probably be here and here. Let them do the ones that will kind of put down any ideas. Because they understand and see the bigger picture. They're much more experienced than understand the, all the details of greater broader business than you. So let them worry about that. Okay, so that's the first one. The second one is, who are we in? What business are we really in? So let's take this one. What is Walmart in the business of? Real estate. Real estate. Is that true? Yeah, it's true. Oh, I bet you'd have a lot of money there. Okay, that's one. What else could you say that there's a fine? What other businesses are they in? Could they be in the logistics and operations business? Oh, yeah. We talked about that just a second ago. How else could you define what business they're in? Customer service. Customer service. Good. Anything else? Retail. Retail. Good. Anything else? Pharmacy. What's a pharmacy? For sure. Automotive. There's a lot of things we can put here. Is this important to find what your strategy is going to be? Yeah, so how those conversations? Don't go in blindly as soon. Okay, let's take this one right here. What business is McDonald's in? Right, right. Jay, now some of you have seen the movie. What movie? Boundary. And what business has McDonald's really in? Real estate. How many of you have not seen the boundary? Great show. There's a really important thing we'll see. Where Ray Crock, who is now the acting head of McDonald's, comes in and he's looking at his new franchises. And how much money to point. And they're not nearly as profitable as they hoped. And his account, he says, Mr. Rock, you know what I'm saying? I think we're in the wrong business here. He goes, what do you mean? They sell French fries, they sell milkshakes, and they sell hamburgers. This is really yeah, but that's not where you're getting your money. He said, what if we just define ourselves as being in real estate business? Where every single person who wants to franchise, they don't buy their own land. They have to rent it for you. That's a steady stream of high profitability. And then you get the extra bonus of having fries and milkshakes. And we'll find it. Does that impact what the McDonald's does business? You know what I'm saying? But how about this one right here? How about you, what do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean? What else? I also can define it. I want to invest in it. Tell us about it. Ethical leaders. What's that? Ethical leaders. Ethical leaders. Is that the business we're in? Should you? I also can you define it? It's on our board. My card, my card. Anybody know? It's on the board of trustees here at VW Alex. What do you think they care about? The church. I even tell you the dollars. The best dinner future. There might be security matters. But why? What's the main driver what are they trying to do? 18 of them? Is it fair to say that the reason why VW exists is that we believe that this investment in you, while sons and daughters of God, we have a return to live with this heaven father. I haven't bothered yet. Is that true? Now, understanding that, does that impact our strategy? Here at VW you? I'm glad you're here. So, if you think about it from the broader perspective, we really understand what the business is. We're really in it. I'm going to have a school. So, in order for us to be successful, we need to know a business where we need to know why we're different. We need to know why we're playing this game. If you were an entrepreneur, how critical is it that you are different? It's important. In business, how important is it to be different? It can't be really different. It can't be really different. I don't want you to know that you don't want to be a market manager. There can be a major after-chir. Is that son of a... I want you to stand up. Stand up. You want to lead us? I said it. I said it. I will do it together. I want you to look at this. There are some true principles here. No matter what type of business you're in. That's why we've learned this cheer. Stand for something. Stand for something. Stand for something different. That's important. Stand for something different. That's important. That's very good. Nice job. Don't say it for everything. Make sure that it's different. Make sure that it's important to whom. Two customers. Really, really simple. No one who we are and what business we're really in, things to do. Let's know ourselves. The other thing we talked about that we have to know is that we have a skill set that we do better than anybody else. Skills are harder to duplicate. You can always duplicate a product. Almost like this. But skills are tough and that usually takes a lot longer than investment. I give you this picture of Southwest. Why is Southwest up there? What does Southwest do? What's a skill that they have that's helped them thrive in the airline world? They have all the same chairs and the plan and all the same plans. Good. They have all the same planes. Did you know that? Seven, three, seven. Seven, seven. It's never one of them. But I'm going to push on you. Yeah. What is that name to do? Well, the maintenance is way cheaper. Delta's maintenance is a mess because they have so many different planes. They have all the parts, all the expertise, theory of our one plane. One set of parts. Good. So it helps me become more profitable. Okay. What else does help me do? We turn around their planes faster. What do you mean by that? That in the time that maybe the other airlines are still waiting at the gate? I have the gate, but other planes are already turned around and they're going to pick up their next flight. That's right. Southwest is very, very good at quick gate types. They're in, they reload because of their, they're so operationally sound, they reload, that if people is, they're out. Usually about half the time that they need the other planes. And if you are not in the gate, what does that mean you're doing? It looks like flying. You're flying. If you're flying, that means you are. Make it, Brian. Make it. You're good. And that makes you look a little... How many of you have ever been stuck in a gate and your plane is there? And you can't get on the plane because the crew hasn't been trained for that plane. Have you ever heard that? Okay? Is that an issue of Southwest? No. Because it's all the same plane. So, this strategic choice as they made, trying to make sure that they're still the fastest turner or sand. This is why they go for the same plane. This is why they make these choices. It's to make sure they don't lose this competitive advantage. Now, the reason why Wall Street, a lot of people are getting pretty nervous about Southwest Airlines, and what are they doing now? It's dirt. It's dirt now. It's trying to be more like other airlines. They've got rid of their back policy. They've got, they changed their boarding system. The things that make customers a butterfly at them, they've got rid of. That's right. And so now, all of a sudden, you've got some things that have really been a differentiator for the passengers. Now, they're even potentially sacrificing their competitive advantage. And who's going to love that? Delta. And United. They're going to love that. Now, jury's still out. That might be wise. I don't know. I haven't done the homework on it. But I'll tell you, strategically, it's risky. So, do you have a strategic, a stable strategic advantage, a skill that you do that can really help you with? Did you have it? Make sure you think about that when you change your strategy. It's another internal thing you need to consider. The last thing is make sure you understand what success looks like. You can mention this before. It's ready, any fire, no fire ready. So, thanks strategically. You know what success looks like. So, three things. Business will teach you in order for you to be successful strategically to make good choices. You need to understand who you really are. What business you're really in. Do you have an SCA strategic competitive advantage? And do you know what success really will look like? Okay. Does that make sense? I don't think it makes sense. For you. Okay. Now, here's the cool thing. When I started teaching this class and I started putting these graphs together, there was an impression that hit me. The impression was, my isn't it interesting that some of the first principles that were revealed to the prophet Joseph Smith or who we really are. Why were really here and what success really looks like? Isn't that interesting? Those were some of the things that were lost. And some of the first thing that a loving company published says, if you want to maximize your agency and make good choices, you need to know these three things. Isn't that interesting? A lot of great foundational principles in the gospel in business. Anyway, something really interesting. I love that we know who we are. I know I am so grateful that I know why we're here. And I'm so grateful that I understand the plan of salvation to know where we can eventually become. And when we make our mistakes, how we can become a union. I love that our primary kids know this. So know yourself, know your fundamental entity, know if you have a strategic competitive advantage, it could be the spirit. And know what success looks like. Now, we talk C company. Now let's move on to a very important C. Let's move over. Okay, we talked about consumers last time a little bit when we introduced the Harvard Business Framework. Just wondering if I remember the slides, this is one of the agencies. So we'll do it just really quick. Demographics. All of you know what that is. Pretty easy. US Census data gets itself this all that very easily. Let's cite your graphics neat. What is cited graphics? Zach? Well, I just kind of figure out how your customer thinks. Good. Yeah, let's try to understand what's going on this little black box that we have in our market. Okay, you're trying to figure out what motivates us. It's the why behind what we do. Is that an important understand when you're running a business? Better feed a BB to see we need to understand what the consumer's value. We need to try to deliver that. So, psychographic, we need to know what's ethnographics. What is that? Yeah, you're early? I would like to say that we're there from one country, some of the cultures. Good, good. Now, you've got a little bit of demographic there too. So what's in it between demographics and ethnographics? Well, if you're a demographic more, like where are they from? Which is NH and all of that, ethno is one of the cultures. Yeah, very good. So, if you really want to understand the culture of a place, what's the best way to understand that culture? Watch them go there. So, ethnography is when you actually allow people to act in their normal ways. Okay, really interesting stuff. So, we'll take you to their own habitats and we'll watch them. Do some fly-on-the-wall research. Or, we sometimes will try to match that flat at home experience in a third-party group that said, you'll do that. Okay. Purchase behavior. Why do we look at... We understand what motivates them and we've watched it. What's in it between that behavior? Why do we want to understand behavior? Alex, do you think this not every single consumer in the world is your hard-eaten someone? Good. And say you don't understand based on their behavior, what they may be a stage of life or what they're trying to be purchasing. Next, I'm going to put it for not a bit. Do you think, yeah, please, just had to. I was just going to say, do I think sometimes the beliefs are like the mindset of what they're doing, just not always mind-up with where they're actually behaving? Yeah, that's fair. Is that fair? How many of you believe it's really important to be kind to each other? Good. How many of us are always kind to each other? How many of you can say? Just Alex. That's pretty good. Yes, I can say. Bill, is that true? I know that working out is really important and I know it's important to be healthy. Okay, do I exercise every day? Do I eat? Hopefully every day? I might cheat quite a bit. So there's a lot of things that we have to be thoughtful. Just because we value something and we believe something and we're being honest, doesn't mean we're going to do it. So, do you understand that? You understand what people are doing. We're just what they're saying. Okay. As a consumer, to get the consumer, we have to put on kind of an attack that acts. We have to really start probing and dig deeper. Now, one of the common areas where we make mistakes is we assume that when we do business, our customer is only an individual user. Sit on that for a second. Does that make sense? Is that true? Is our customer always the end user? Jennifer, you should have known why. You know, because there are situations like, how can I put it, you buy something for your child, you buy this for someone else? You know, I say, I'm a per se, I'm a per se, I eat less of what I buy for me than what I buy for someone else. And so, I'm not sure I think about that in business. Let's see, B2B. The person is potentially going to buy your product, is he going to use it? Probably not. So, what I want you to do is when you think about consumer, I want you to take off those little blinders. And think about consumer from a more broad perspective. It's not the myopic, it's not the mere thing. It's really what you need to be consumer in a way that you know it now. Some really important lessons can be taught on business to business. If you look at the negotiations and the thing that happened within the business to business setting, you're going to find that there are users at the firm, you're going to value the product that you're offering. And you might also find those people are actually different than the ciders of whether or not that product is being pledged. Which also might be really different than the people are trying to persuade a buyer, of which brands that go with, or which companies they don't do business with. Which is, it goes right back to the buyers doing the negotiation, trying to identify which vendors they are out of here instead. Which is also really different than someone called it, gauge. What's it? Person, a nice and financial person. Okay, it could be the person that makes up financial decisions. So, let me bring this kind of, make this kind of look a little bit more bold. So, buyers, they buy. They also negotiate. They actually identify the vendors. You're going to have purchasing departments and be in businesses, businesses, businesses, businesses. How many of you have been a buyer? Anybody here? I've been a seller. You've been a buyer before? No. Okay. How many of you sold into a buyer? Okay, a few people sold into a buyer. Diego, when you're a buyer, are there people that are trying to influence your decision? Yeah, I know. Okay, so like who? Yeah, I work in a factory company, so I'm really trying to hire people with specific suppliers to buy a spare part or to provide a service. Okay, good, good. And so, you might have people on the line that are going to feel different ways. Do you think a county is going to be caring about which company you choose? What about finance? Do you think they're going to care? Yeah, you bet. And so, what about the people on the line that are actually using the product? You think they're going to care? No. You get a lot of voices that are going to be doing the same decision. So buyers, they buy, they negotiate. Involuntary, they try to persuade. Okay, they try to persuade you to see their perspective. Okay, the sideers are the ones that are going to like the final role kit for you. Okay, those are the ones that use the like, okay, yes, you're approved. A lot of times, these are past buyers that have a higher signing authority. Right? Because these are the ones that usually your boss is boss. Right? They're the ones, especially the big ticket items, the ones that are a little bit higher up. You've got users, that's pretty easy to use. They're the ones that consume the product. Thank you for that, K-keepers. Now, K-keepers are a little bit different. By terminology, by definition, K-keepers shield them. They limit access to the buyer. They control the flow of information to the buyer. So, this way I want you to think about K-keepers. You know what TV here in the movies? You can see like in New York, like in that club. And you have a voucher at the door, and they've got a list of who gets in, who gets out. You see that big, big line? People go in, like what's your name? Sorry, you know, I'm a list screener. And then the other people are like, oh yeah, you're on the list. Go ahead, go ahead. That's a gatekeeper. Okay? So, the buyer will say, hey, I've got a dozen people that I want you to consider, that I want to meet with, that I'm going to be listening to, and I'm going to be buying from. There's a hundred other vendors that still want to do business with us. I don't have time to meet with all of them. So, keep the gate closed to them. But if they're on that list, schedule appointments and a lot of them. And they shield the buyer from other unwanted requests. Does that make sense? Okay, so buyers, what do they do? By-by. Influencers, what do they do? They persuade. Deciders, what do they do? The final okay. Gatekeepers. They shield, they limit access. In users, they use that makes sense. Can I help you? Yes. So, think about you lunch. How many of you play very different roles? They all be at lunch? So, James, I want to think about you a little bit. You were the user, right? Okay. Were you the buyer? Yes. So, you bought it? Were you the insider? Yes. Okay, so there's three right there. Okay. Now, was there any gatekeepers involved? Yes. They were there in my wife. Okay, very good. Explain. Well, maybe I wanted to buy other things, but she was like, let's get something up here. Okay, very good. So, I'm not an influencer anymore. Now, probably the influencer cooking. Or, more so an influencer, but. Can I be gaking? Let's say you're a timed crunch. You're the... And you're here at the Married School? Are you limited? Does that make sense? You're the Married School potentially to be considered a gatekeeper. There. So, except... Yes, please. Well, I'm not saying that I actually think a lot of scenarios, you're buying things that you have people playing with, or what? Oh, yeah. So, like, when I worked for a marketing company in college, and I was both a gatekeeper and a user. So, like, my boss would take every demo with every company to reach out to us. She's like, I don't want to deal with this. You think it sounds cold, unless I got it. I'm like, would you sit? Or you could see the news, because you know what we do. Yeah. It's not a sound effect. I'm not saying that I have anything to do with the decision. I have nothing to do with it. I'm not saying that I'm the decision. But I... Because I was a user, I was kind of a gatekeeper in that. I'm not saying that. And then you first say it. I'll tell you. So, let's take my home. Let me give you another real-world example. Okay. In my home, in our kitchen, we have computers. Okay. I have six boys in my home. All right? That computer is being used constantly. All right. Now, I know as a dad that computers can be used for good, and it can be used for you. Okay. I know that there are some downsides down in computers. The internet has got a lot of good stuff. And also, there are vendors out there that want access to my kids. I really don't want them to get access to my kids. So, as a dad, I influence. I try to teach my children, hey. There's dangers if you're online. And I try to teach them about those things. I'll take them to church. And hopefully, I'll be able to try and persuade them to make their choices when these... this temptation might come around to go to business sites and probably aren't the best for it. Okay. And so, I've influenced them. I'm trying to persuade them. I'm also gatekeeping. How can I gatekeep in my home? How can I limit access to my friends? I'm trying to encourage the guys. Does that make sense? You see the difference? One's actively persuasion. One's just putting up filters and making it harder for them to get access. Does that make sense? So, that's the difference. One persuades one's shields. One more that has to be. And can like outside organizations be gatekeepers? Sure. Like access to information. There should be a number of things that should be kept. I want the kitchen. Well, I'm still on the danger to the wall. There are things that are legal channels. There are legal channels. There are kind of gatekeepers, and so on. Yes. Maybe in a big company, they're rules. Yeah. They put to... They were internally. Yeah, there are many suppliers, or not. This is a way to have gatekeepers. Good, Diego. Yeah, that's a really good example. Okay. Now, that's B2B. What about B2C? Same. Exactly. Okay. So, are there users? Are there designers? Influencers? Yeah. Yeah, check-tracking. All of us. So, again, think about it. If I am running Chef Boyard E. Do I just want to do some users? Am I going to build my business the way that I own the way I need to build my business? I need to grow up, and I need to find the only looking app end users. Who do I need to talk to? People with my laws. Who do I need to have a spice-skip mom? You talk about limiting my potential size of my business. I'm going to think about the entire bike center. So, let's give you an example. Okay. So, whether it be B2B or B2C, you have this bind center. You need to make sure that we're looking at it. Let me give you a real world series. So, I was watching Modern Family the other day. Watching your rerun. And I'm going to give you this little overview. Let's see if you can identify the Modern Family. Who the key players are in this episode. Now, the boy in the home. What's his name? Luke. Luke. Luke's there. This is when Luke is the first season. So, Luke's a little boy. He's driving around a bike. And it's time for him to get a new bike. And I'm going to let you see this little new ones. And see if you can identify who the user should be, the buyer, the inciders, the gatekeepers, and the other side. Ready? I'm going to turn this up just a little bit. It's a little louder. So, here we go. Oh, what's up? What's up? What's up, buddy? Grandma? I'm sorry. That still looks like a girl's bike. I'm a bike tape. My son has been riding his sister's old bike. Until he's responsible enough to take care of his own bike clip. He's built a soda on my computer. He ruined our digital camera taking pictures of himself at their water. It's a girl's bike. I'm all for teaching in the last time. But I worry about the ridicule he might get from some loud mouth bully. Nice bike, Sally. Dad. I'm not a real boy. We'll go keep on that thing. Actually, not for long. He's getting a new bike this afternoon. I am. He is? Sometimes. A man's got to put his foot down and do what a man's got to do. And if you'll lady don't like it. Honey? You get it. Yeah, so let's go play with it. Who's the user here? Who? Who's going to be the buyer? Dad. Probably Phil is. Dad's going to be the buyer. And if you watch the episode, that does go by the buyer. Who's going to be in? Who's the influencer in this scenario? Jay. Jay. Grandpa. Right? I like him so. All right. Gamekeeper. Hard to see on this swim. Typically, who's the gamekeeper in this household? Claire. Claire. Typically, it's going to be mom. Oh, by the way, influence is going to be anybody with him. That's right. It could be anybody. But usually gatekeepers are going to be mom. And then the decider on this particular example. That probably is dad. All right. Jay, use your hands. All right. Does that make sense? See how that all kind of works together? So when you're looking at these really look for opportunities. Because here's the cool thing. When you understand who these players are, it opens up a little, just a little, just a ton of strategies for you. To understand what type of message that buyer cares about. What type of message is the influencers care about? What about those users? Or if it's mom and dad deciding together, which usually happens. Okay. Do you understand the dynamics? What about it work? If you're selling medical device, what identifies the problem? Is that going to be different than the person you're going to be buying from? Is that going to be different than someone that actually goes and has the final decision on it? Whether it's not that you invested in some medical device. You see the differences? If you understand, if you take those blinders off and look at the entire buying center. Now all of a sudden, there are strategies that really become more complex and hopefully more effective. So don't get into this myopic view of consumers. It's so many of us get into it. Now when you're reading this week, you had a chance to dive a little bit into these board services. This is a big and emerging area. And you also had a chance to learn a little bit about the roles that they play when it comes to product development. When it comes to future growth opportunities. And with the nuances of today's world, on the differences between macro and micro. When we come back, we'll talk more about that. All right? Great discussion today. See you next time."
