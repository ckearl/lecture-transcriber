  "text": "If you decide as the marketer, the strategy you're going to put forth based on the data, but there's not like one right answer that emerges from data. That's right. There may not be always a right answer. In fact, most of the time there isn't. Right? And we talked about strategies all about choices and strategies all about fly and flying knowledge. Right? We could make a good argument after that discussion, why we should go after group C, right? The ones that have history and history. We could make a good argument under the Andrew Bay. But the more we understand the more we analyze these different consumer segments, the more open we'll be able to make a choice that's going to be getting unrestracted. We're trying to be comfortable. So, break in silence. Yes, please. Prioritize your key metrics and your key metrics should be behind your key values. Good. What do you mean by that, Brad? When you say key values, what do you mean? Because what he wanted to do was, if I remember right, he wanted to kind of serve that population that did not have access to banking or did not. He wasn't really already in the industry. So, key metrics were more new customers and people that, you know, rather than trying to take from a competitor. That's human. So, notice what we just did here. We took two seas and worked together. We looked internally what our objective is. What does success look like for us? Does that potentially help us kind of determine which strategy we choose? Yeah. Right? If we say we want to stand for this, there's going to be some strategies that might help us get there more effectively than others. If that's not as important to us, then we might go over completely different strategies. Probably the one that most of the work with us. The other big banks are doing. So, understanding us internally is really important in the other big banks. Well, again, I hope you saw that we're not teaching you false doctrine in this class. No matter what the industry is, did you notice they were still, when they started these, they were the four seas, then they went to the moon, and then within who it's who could we, and who should we, and then what are we going to say, and then how are we going to implement? Again, strategy, there's more than one way to do it, and now it's just determining on our rationale. Which one would you choose from? And when each of you go in and start recommending your strategies, your choices, no matter what industry you're in, what your focus is, use that same blow of logic. You wouldn't there be able to prepare the wise and the why not. So, that was the first thing we talked about. We also talked about the importance of diagnosing the purchase sequence. And I introduced you to what the purchase sequence was. Do you remember the purchase sequence? Do you remember what that was? Market size. Good. Starts with market size, is the forecast for our estimation of our market better than others? And we introduced you to this entire setup. Each one of us is consumers, go through this process individually. And so because of that, when we are running into a problem diagnosing our business, and trying to find out why we did the ejection member, the goal we were trying to hit, we can help use this to break down real estate often. Let's take market size. Okay? Just have a, just for, I'm going to just take a little poll here for fun. Market size, let's say you're an entrepreneur in Newseye, you're going to open up a t-shirt business here in the state of Utah. Okay? Does understanding the demographics from the size of the state of Utah and the population matter? If you're trying to figure out how big you're going to build this business, does that matter? You bet. And so understanding that market size is going to be key. So here's what I want to do. That anybody can look at it. Let's see if you know what the market size is. All right. All right. So everybody, you know what I do? These blindfolds, right? This stuff, those are eyes, it's exciting. If you believe that the population of Utah is larger than 10 million people, go ahead and open up your mouth. Those are eyes, go ahead and open your hands. Great. Thank you. If you believe that it's between 9 and 10 million, open up your head. Thank you. 8 and 9 million. Thank you. 7 and 8 million. Thank you. 6 and 7 million. Thank you. 5 and 6 million. 4 and 5 million. Thank you. 3 to 4 million. Thank you. 2 to 3 million. Thank you. 1 to 2 million. Thank you. 1 to 2 million. Okay. Very good. You can go open up your eyes. Hey. There were probably maybe a quarter of you that actually knew what the size of Utah is. Three-quarter of us did not. So if you are using your golden guts to determine all the you, three-quarters of you may have been a little off on your market side. Let's see actual size of Utah. 3.2 million. Staying very good. I'm going to go over there to you. Some of you they put 10 million. In my last class, I had four or five people say that was under a million. So think about that. How much is that impact of the potential forecast? I'm from a small town in China. We only have like a million people. It's a small town. But it was like a village. It's really kind of green. But you've seen the impact. If you go in there and say you know what I always said, it's been filling a million t-shirts and you don't. Well, okay, was it because our original forecast number was 10 million. Now all of a sudden I assumed that there was a new percent of the aware. I guess that's why. Maybe 50 percent of that rely just now at 2.5. Right? And so on. All of a sudden you don't meant that number. Well, why? Was it your awareness estimation? Or was it the market size estimation you and you? See how that breaks that down? So please think about this. We could back it in to be able to understand where things may have gone wrong. Okay? And it opens up strategy. So if you find out the things are broken here, let's say you didn't add and you didn't resonate. Let's say you chose positioning. Or you chose or is it wall? I don't know how to pronounce it. It keeps getting stuck. Is it wall? Wall of a. Wall of a. Wall of a. I like that. Okay, so let's say you got these different options. And your position you did resonate with the target you were going for. Well, you naturally break down. So you use this as a one-down tool and hope you identify where you can go. Now if you mix that with the buying center, now the sudden you can really get some nice strategic understanding of where you could go next and how to start making decisions to really tackle business in politics. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about the size of the price. Here's the one thing that I want all of you to do. We talked about consumer. I want all of you to remember this very important phrase. In other fact, I want you to even kind of list. I want everybody to stand up. I want you guys to promise me something. I want you to go over your best girl scout, boy scout, cut scout, sign. Whatever it is, I want you to do it after me. Okay? I promise. I will remember. I will remember. But I am not. And I am not. Always the consumer. Always the consumer. Too big of a... What's... Let's talk about it. Does this happen? Does this happen? Yes. You know, I will tell you the biggest benefit that I ever had in my career was not being the consumer of one of the brands that I changed. I remember. My first business, I had a chance to work up in Melibu and I worked on sports drinks, sports bars, and nutritional supplements. Health stuff. Remember, my background, I was too far away from going to a top-country school. And so for me, this was right down my line of interest. I'd love this stuff. I knew the anatomy and the physiology and the school went on behind me to the products. I could talk to the doctors. I could talk to the superiors. I felt like he was like my secret strategic competitive advantage. My next lighted business, ready? Skin care and cosmetics. Me. I am not the consumer. Your skin's glowing though. I mean the lot. I'm not a consumer here. I remember when I first got this assignment, I was like, no. How am I supposed to market this? I don't understand this category. I'm not interested in this category. I don't even know what a T zone is. Right? I don't know. How many of you guys like? One is that. One is that. What is it? T zone is going down. It's your forehead. No. So I think this is something that I've just talked about. It's like, now all of a sudden I'm a now-induced student. I even understand this business. And then I went to my first market research. And I heard consumers talk about their T zone. And talked about the challenges that they have in their skincare ratings. And all of a sudden I'm sitting there talking to your grandmother and manager. I told her, I sure think she should do it. She said that. When I've been trying something like this, we saw that problem. When we did this, and we started bracing, and I remember driving home and going, okay, I like what I do. I like what I do. I don't have to be the consumer. And I don't tell you, I feel like in the brand where I was not the consumer. I do my best to business work. Because I didn't have to rely on my golden gut. I have to listen. So please, take comfort in that. When you go out of the industry, you don't have to be the consumer of what you are selling. You have to love what you do. That's the key. And so think about that. It's when we use our golden gut, and we start assuming that we are just like the other consumers that we're selling to. Sometimes we make mistakes. So listen. I'm not saying that you might be right with certain seconds, but you might be wrong too. Go value. Go and see for some understanding you consumer. Don't just assume that you are them, even when you've been on this business worldwide. Now today, today I want to see if you were anything. Good weather to measure. You're probably a little scratchy. So what we're going to do is we're going to play a game that I call, did as much as you think. An honor of that. Here we go. We're going to win as much as we can to do this game. I'm going to have to do the buy-up thing a little bit. Now I'm going to have you even move a little bit. So here's what we're going to do. Can I ask the three of you to hand the two of you over to this section? See you. See you. What do you want to do? Yeah. Can I ask you to buy a short game on this? Yep. You can buy a short game on this. You can buy a short game on this. Yep. You can buy a short game on this. Okay. Yeah. What do you do? Start moving. You're a big guy just see. I'll see. You know. I'm not sure if you're going to play this game too. You're going to play this game. You got two, four, six, eight, two, four, nine. Okay, we're going. All right. Let's do this. Let's have Haley and J. I knew it wasn't. I knew it wasn't done. All right. So J. Let's have this each two groups here. Let's have two teams. This group here. You're going to have to set one up. Your versus Simon, puddle together. We have one trained home over here for Team Dave and the team captain. One and... How does it go? American weather. I thought you said that. That's all I need. That's all I need. That's all I need. That's all I need. I'm going to team up that. One day. I'm going to have to play the winner. I'm going to have to play the winner. Can you think of the thing? There you go. Oh, another. I'm going to take this. I'm going to take this. Like, sing, sing, no. What's the else? What's the else? I'm going to have to sing. I'm going to have to work. Yeah. I think we said it. I think we said it. I never spoke to none in my life. So was this me before the most? I was really interested to know. I was really interested to know. I'm going to play a girl. I think it's a pretty easy one. I'm going to say it. It's totally me though. It's like... It's like... Never said a thing about life. I'm absolutely... In my... My friend works like... Around the office. I used to do this. I was like... Here we got the hard part of the business. And then we... Yeah. I'm just going to have to do this. What time? It's so nice. Send him. Yeah, God. I don't know. It's for here for more. Yeah, you got this part. It's in the end of the year. I think we're on the phone. Yeah. And we're like... We're like... 200 dollars. Oh, that's a pretty good one. It's so nice. All right, we got it. Okay. She is Team Gatsule. And this. So you've been... Team first up. You should have been... Down. Down. Okay, down. What's your team name? Our team name is going to be... Winners. Winners. That's good. You're the... More marketing. More and a lot of us. Okay, Team over here. Team Gats. Team Gats. Go and take that. The golden dots? Good. Good. Good. Good. Team. Team Gats. Team Gats. Nice. Like that. Very good. No. What do you see? Papa Peter. Papa Peter. There's no team name is for him. For him? Or hit. No, man. The first round. The first round. All right. Okay, so... What is your team name? Against each other this game. That name. Name of the game? Winner. Winner. All right. Now, here are the ground rules for him as much as he can. Okay? First. I have given... You'll see on the board that I've got a bunch of different rounds here. I can go 10, I do it 12, I like going more. That's not how much time you have. All right. We've got our different team names right here. We're going to be adding these up as we go all the way to high. Now, each round that we have, I'll be between 30 and 60 seconds. Right here. There'll be multiple rounds. As you meet with each other, as you talk to each other, you can talk collectively as a group and develop your strategy, but you cannot communicate with the other teams. Okay? Verbaly or nonverbaly? Okay. You'll be held up if you do. All right. Is that cool? All right. Yes. We don't want a neurological connection. That is competitive now. Okay. Perfect. Right. There you go. I am here. I'm here. You're... Team Winnie's down to the table. These are the team Winnie's having X and Y papers. These represent price points. Because... Okay. Right here. Right here. Right here. You're going to charge, price, and actual price points. Charge Y. And each one of you represent a manufacturer. All right? And your goal is to win as much as you can. Okay? Now, each team is going to decide whether or not they're going to play the X card or the Y card on each round. You have to be able to show those immediately when I go 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, declare. When I say declare immediately, that price needs to go up. Does that make sense? It's like paper oxygen. You've got to go in cheaper places. All right? And that's crazy. You've shown immediately a six-on-one. If you don't, once again, heavily pedal up. Right? Okay, now here is kind of the heart. I'm looking at this one. This one. Okay? And YC 4 X's. You've all moved. A dollar each. It should be the prisoner's along. It should be the prisoner's along. If you got... If you got... If you got... If you got... If you got... If you got... If you got... Two X's, you win $2. Why is it lose 2? One X win 3. Why is it lose 1? Or win 3? They're up to give me an ace one. Here we got that. So here's what I want you to do. I'm going to give you a minute. I talked to the lunch team. Figure out the strategy. And let's win as much as you can. Art's in it. Go! Go for it. It's a nice team. I was thinking of... What video? I think I was trying to think of it. If we... The most that we can lose... And we're in it. It was a joke. It was a joke. No, it's not that funny. It's not that funny. It's not that funny. It's not that funny. But it feels like... It's half the... It's half the... It's half the... It's half the... It's really win 3. It's half the... It's half the... It's half the... It's half the... Last minute. Which is very easy. It's a very easy... It's a nice... Ya! It's half the... I'm gonna have to go. I'm gonna have to go. Oh, there's a lot of people. I don't understand. Everybody needs a place. I don't leave you with all five. No one wants to. I get mine. All right, everybody. Okay, my page. No! No! Slide! Slide! Three! Two! One! Declare! X! Ah! Everybody!

If we had done $5, we would have lost $3. Okay, okay, okay, okay. We have $5. You have to pay for your money. Okay, okay. Slide! It's okay. We can't lose it. It's okay. It's okay. We're the first ones. We don't have to pay. We're all getting high. Four! One! Declare! You're the first one to pay! We're the first ones to pay! You've got to buy a bit of us.

But that's, no, I know what you're gonna be doing! but it would be time to say anything. Yeah My Here we go Two, one, declare. Ben burned once, it's never. They're just really selfish, but I'm curious. We are. Yeah, we know it. All right, let's go ahead and ask. I'm going to go back to the same area. Let's look at that. One, four, three, two, one. I like it. One, four, three, two, one. I'm going to go ahead and say, We can just be ongoing. I know it's going to happen. Nice job. Let's tell you things out. Let's see where we're going to go. Thank you. I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. I'm going to leave. Sorry guys. I thought I'd trust all of you. I'm sorry. All right. Trying to visit our seat. impact your brand. What do you think of our MBAs? What do you think of our MBAs? I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. Not very smart. Alright, let's now get things. First off, who's our waiting? We're waiting. We're using our brand. We're using our band, Sheep Out On Talks. And thanks to that last round, especially, they came out on top of it. Not again. That's our negative, I think. Oh, because they did a great job. She's on a winner's side. She's on a winner's side. And then go all the guts. Hey, we were positive. We're going to start with this. Obviously, it's a fun little simulation. So now let's talk about what you've learned from this. I want you to notice what the talent was. Well, actually, before I do this, let's go here. What was your strategy? Why would you do what you were doing? I think it was my fault. My hope was sometimes you have to stand out to be a market leader. And then others, rather than just losing a dollar at a time, would actually see that if we all just put wise, we'd call make it all right at the time. And that didn't quite play out. Which we just said, we'd imagine that strategy by trusting whatever cow-wow after-nil there, the leader wasn't part of it. So please, I'll think about the story close about the warm climate we get with premium. And now you didn't go through it because you didn't want to get hacked from our business. And then drive the old negated trip ahead of it. Didn't want to start a flash drive. And I think we felt very comfortable turning everyone because there's numbers on the like word. But if these have been real dollars and all of a sudden we're all competing very aggressively with each other, you know what I'm saying about that? Well, we're going to come out on top obviously. In the end, we're going to line ourselves. Yeah, the rules were to win as much as you can, right? So not as not be higher negative numbers, like not lose less than other people. So if it hadn't been for the, you know, 100X, everyone would have been in the negated truly if it was like consistent scoring that route. Very true. Please do something different as expensive. These guys, they say they trust to do something different, but they lost money. And sometimes companies do the same. Actually, I always think about the case of Apple with Apple Vision Pro. It was a mess. Yeah, but it was awesome that technology has. But they are innovating, but they are losing so much money. That's the end of the day. Do we have to answer what could happen next? I would argue that our team is going to be able to win. Everybody else played not to lose. Do you know how to act as a bad side? It's a school board. It's an entire risk, but if everybody had been playing, the only way we would have all ended up getting positive is if we'd all done wise. Yeah, that's where it turns. So why didn't we? We don't trust Peter. Not playing. I have to work. Of course. We're all going to spend for ourselves to stop. I guess the market in this case, right? We're all perfectly in time with the idea of, I can go down as long as everybody goes down with me. Whereas our team, I guess, wasn't. We were willing to sacrifice ourselves for you folks. Thank you. Thank you. You would have ended up with another section. I think we would have all acted all the interesting. No, that's fair. What I would tell you is the other section, we actually made more than you. I would have thought you were going to do that. I don't know. I'm still happy to admit. So, in this particular scenario, the benefit of all cooperating was less than the cooperating. Like, one person not cooperating. Like, one person not cooperating. Like, actually, the biggest gain, as we saw. Right? And so, like, if the four wise winning $10 each, or $100 each, if that was a scenario, I think we all would have voted yes. Because it wasn't actually that beneficial. It was the second most significant gain. What was the last one? How exact? But that one was just a shame. Right? And it was the other one. Please, down. Yes. The point here is that I think it's a short-term benefit for this team to take advantage of everybody else depending together or it's kind of defaulting on the agreement. But, long-term, each costs, okay, everybody, once the trust is broken, then we're obviously going to lose this. That is going to be better. So, yeah, we should start just essentially out of my first out, if everyone goes to X, like, the whole market loses money, if everyone goes to Y, then there's more value of that into the market than anything in between. It's just neutral. It's zero. Yes. So, let's talk about that really quick. What did you remember what role I played? How's the retail? How did I do? Great. Great. You're really talented. Actually, Karu's adding the second, because I went to the second. I lost four here, four here, four here. Didn't win anything. Lost four to here. Didn't win anything. Lost 80 here. How am I doing? Really bad. Okay, now, who are your shoes? Who are your sales in my shoes? I'm the retail. What does this mean for the category? To your son. Joseph? I mean, I would just drop the category. I'm losing money a year after a year. I would just sell something else in the same space. Yeah. Remember I kept on saying, over and over, if you win, I win. They won't turn. So, let's look at it. This team won. Right? Right? Yeah. Well, I'm in here. You're thinking, you're saying, I don't know who won. You actually don't know who won? Yeah, so, let's say that I'm a retailer, which I am in this scenario. Am I going to want to reward bad player behavior? No. No. What do I want? What are my goals and my objectives? Money. I want to make money. And I want a profitable category. Okay? I get bonus done that. I want your or your same sort of growth. That's what I want. How am I doing? Terribly. Now, you have a fixed amount of space in a retailer's environment. Should I go and invest in negative profitability, or do I go ahead and invest in something that might be a little bit more beneficial to your long-term? What happens if these only represented a week? After nine weeks, if I saw this type of behavior, think of my name back to your business? Is that the game long-term? Yeah, please. We may have lost the game, but we may be the only brand you keep. That is very true. Congratulations. Oh! Hey, yeah. Let me show you. First off, let me tell you what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that you go cheat and go and collude on price. Not that. But let me tell you what I am. I want to once again reinforce that idea. When you make a strategic choice, you must ask yourself, if I do this, what will happen to my four C's? How many of you thought about that? If I make a choice, what will happen to root to it? Anything that? Should you? Okay, so let me teach you a real world scenario, where this actually happens. I'm in return at Bristol-Mire Squid. Now, let me tell you about the infant formula categories. There are unwritten rules in this category that the major players all live by. Okay? Here are the rules that we live by. But I've learned right when I came in as an intern. Here are the rules in the game. One. Infant formula is not superior to a mother's breast milk. That is the mindset that all of us had to have, because it was true. The infant formula is not as healthy for babies. It's not. But there are some babies that struggle with mother's breast milk. There are some moms that are hard-time with breast milk. And so we have a solution for those consumers. Okay? But we also recognize that because this is better for the breast milk is better for the baby, we are going to do a couple things. One, we will not advertise. Because we are not going to show and try to promote something that's going to be negative to a baby. That was rule number one. Rule number two is we knew that we still had more growth to go in developing a better product. And so we would invest millions of dollars every year on creating a new breast milk. The special design from Niki Kids. Or a new breast milk, where students work, where students, where infants have a hard time with lactose. Or they have a hard time with other types of things. Get colic or whatever it may be. And so we would invest millions of dollars each every year. We would do it the other day. So this is the first one we are squib with, N-familm. Our leading competitor, who actually we had about a share about, we had each had about 45 share in the market place. It was real as a human. It was rossed by similar, similar like viral hospital. And they were dedicated, that's anything. Our pricing really close to each other. Okay? Almost as parity. The remaining 10% was for private label. Private label, wasn't quite as good for the kids, for the infants, but it wasn't that. And so it was about 20% less. Okay. Now, that's the rules in which we live. We wouldn't promote you. Let doctors have that conversation with moms and let them sell if it was appropriate for mom and me. That's it. What do you think of those rules? I tell you, when I came in, I heard this, I was like, wow, business can be kind of benevolent in some ways. This is good. And it rained true, I lifestyle. Okay, so, midway through my internship, all of a sudden we have a new entry. Nestle decides to come into the market place. And Nestle has had an infant formula that had been using over in Europe, and they've been doing pretty well. So we got word that they were coming in, and we're like, okay, all right, well, let's see how they do. We knew scientifically that their formula was not very good. It wasn't very nutritious for kids. It wasn't unhealthy, but it wasn't beneficial. Even our private label was significant in the better. They wouldn't Nestle was offered. Nestle comes in and they want to steal shares. So what do they do? What's that, Alex again? They run an app. They run multiple apps. Television, magazines, everywhere. Come try our product. Now I also said we're going against the other rules. That's not the only thing they did. What else did they do? They called it lower the price. Say that again. Lower the price. They lower the price. 50% lower than the national price. 50, I swear. I don't even know if they were profitable to do that. Okay, so we have a big plumber here. Guess what happened to our share? It started to take me. So what are we doing to turn? We're going to land X or do we play Y? A little meeting. Go to the league of the club. Go to the league of the club. We're going to the club right now. Go to jail. I don't know if we can laugh. Alright. Hey, so that's what we have. So do we just go ahead and say okay? I'll see your 50% off. I'm going to take it down. If I do that, what's civil acting Ross? They're going to be the same. And then what's going to happen? Everybody's losing. How's the retailer doing? Terribly. How they consumers do it? Are they? So wait a second. Yes, great. Is it good to have a less expensive product in the market? Yes. It could be. Well, at what cost? It's good. Well, you're communicating to your consumer that essentially necessarily is the same quality as the matter of stuff. Is that fair? So if we start now cost cutting, what does that mean? What's going to happen? Well, you're not going to have as much cash to invest in making us better formulas. We're talking about it. Interesting. It's important that it's a whole. It's not going to get better. And is that good for consumers? No. See the dilemma? What's nice? So what can you as a manufacturer do when you can't go and do a bridge recommending it? Go collaborate. Every time. You can go and advertise and now is that going to go over? Not that great. But better than price? Better than price probably. But now you're going against those key objectives that you laid out. And going, are you being untrue to kids and moms? And there's a trust implications for you and doctors. Is that going to brown down? Is that going to impact you going forward? Tough. So what can you do? Costs? What can a retailer do? What can a retailer do? Costs? This way. Featured. Okay. So that's exactly what we did. So we legally couldn't go to our competitors. But we couldn't legally go and just teach our retail partners what the implications are for a Nestle strategy. And say, okay, look what's going to happen here, Mr. and Mrs. Retailer. Is this what you want? And collectively, the two major retailers that we went to, they're like, no, we can help on that. So we just reminded you as a retailer did a final choice on price. Once you buy it, you can charge whatever you'd like. Could you potentially send a signal to Nestle that this behavior isn't right for the category? What could they do? They give it charge hires. They maybe charge it with like pridle labels chart. Now, if you're Nestle, if you see that, what are you going to do? You're going to raise your prices. Good, yeah. But what else, then might you do? Invest in developing the better product. Yeah. And luckily, that's what happened. So the retailer looked at them and said, hey, we get it, okay? But this is not healthy to the category. It's not about you, it's about the category. I don't care what brand we're selling. I care about the category growth. And right now, you are playing Y. And everybody else is playing X and you can kill. You all play Y. You're playing X and everybody else is. If you do play, you can use this Y strategy. Maybe you can do something that will benefit everybody. And great, that's what happened. You did it legally and we did it the way that was really helpful. Now, I promise you, every category that you are going to look at, each one of you are going to work with retailers that have, or you're going to work in different categories that have unwritten rules. And you just need to make sure that you've done your four C's well enough to make sure you understand, am I considering, you know, if my choices are wrong against these rules and if so, what's going to happen then? If there's thoughts on that, please money. Is there a point at which you see about getting out of the rules and putting the right A? No, it's fair. It's a fair point. I mean, as an industry, yes, I would think that you could do something about that. I don't think it happens very often, but it's new shit. I mean, just in terms of necessarily prior to their interview as market, you saw what they did in September after and you told me what strategy they're going to be there. And I was established some from law that very, very different. Other shit, like. There's a question. So we're assuming that, next we did their research and they knew about the unwritten rules and act that we chose to break them. Yeah. Do you think this could have been innocent? No, no. You like it. That's a very interesting question. How many days? That is way too late. Peter, what do you guys think? Well, so it's a point that's true. Well, to reference, the thing that Monty's talking about, they also get advertised in verbal countries to say, well, actually this is healthier than mother-president. And so, like, that's the best of companies that I will never work for. Because I think they're mostly evil. But, like, no, they were actually choosing to do things that were unethical. I think it's naive to think that, oh, if they accidentally just wrote the rules, they didn't know about it in the US market. They did. No, I mean, look, could there be some smaller companies that go in blindly and entrepreneur's, sure, I think so. When you've got the dollars and the research and the amount of brains are going to think you're there. But, you know, luckily we had a partner to be able to help us. But the only reason why they were willing to help us is why. Why did the retailer want to help us? Because they went, I went they went. Right? They care about the capital. And so, in some instances, not all, but in some instances, you'll find that you can be very competitive. You can be incredibly aggressive, but still play within the rules of the business. And you'll be able to benefit the entire cash. Don't burn the house down. Just to get ahead. Sorry, page three. Okay? Sometimes you're not even willing. Okay? Now, I'm not saying start doing duality, duality, duality, you're not going to lie out. You're saying, look, be smart and ask what's going to happen next. When you make a choice, are you thinking about it? Okay? That's the key here. Now, today, we're going to move from consumers. We're going to start talking a little bit about the channel. I want you to think about channel. First up, channel is the most ignored seat out there. Like, just last week I was talking to a person in the industry, and they referred to the three seats. And what seat was ignored? Channel. Channel. Now, in some industries, I did it. If you're a B2B player, and if you don't work with any retailers at all, and you don't use any external, I did it. I did it. But in those industries where you do, and you have suppliers, and you have vendors, it's critically known that it goes with what. Really known as that, because they impact everything. We think about it. Let's think this right here. Quality. Just channel. Impact quality. A product. Explain how does that, I mean, you're the manufacturer. How does channel impact quality of product? Please. Yeah. Well, it depends, like, how over the finance, but if I'm 19, yes, my channels are, like, these offshore factories, and then, like, the three POs, and everyone's, like, I maybe don't have, like, both ownership of the factories. And so, I guess all that to say, I'm just trying to move the question. Oh, you're fine, you're rigged. But yeah, I guess I'm just thinking of quality, like, yeah, sorry, I was moving my shirt about, but it's important to, uh, to make sure that your channels have, like, high standards, or, uh, meat, your standards as well. Good. So, if you're working with them, and it's outboarded, it's to make sure that the quality of your raw ingredients are coming in, and the broker loves it. So, that impact you? Yes. Okay, how about the other side? Well, I'm going to have to have you retail it. Get a retailer impact to your quality level. Got it. Well, I'll visit Sal Joonry, for example. Yes. I don't sell in Guamany. I like to sell, like, a specialized place. People proceed as well, not, I guess. That come into it. Good. So, the channel of your choice could potentially impact your perception of your brand. How? Uh, kind of an example that's outside of, like, consumer goods. Yes. So, in the summer sales industry, I have one of my best friends for a few years, sold directly to you. But then his company also got license to sell dish. It's a big, it's a little bit, right? And, um, but the thing is, it quickly found that, like, I don't remember which one, but, like, one of them, more people could be approved. One of them more people just had a better general deal for. So, like, probably, probably, probably, probably, probably, probably, probably, through his summer, he just ditched the one, right? So, like, a retailer matters because if you're not providing a quality service or product, then they're going to pitch on the bottom shelf, they're going to not try. Right? They're going to promote the one that they have more confidence. Okay? It's fair. Thank you. You all, yeah, please send it. Oh, if you're, like, a brand and you're creating something, like, if you're creating Calvin Klein clothing for TJ Maxx, or whatever, would that be, like, a channel considered? Do you have that? So, let's say you are TJ Maxx, and you want to be able to start with Calvin Klein. Could that relationship impact the quality of Calvin Klein? Perception, yes. But what about physical quality? Could. Or the, think about the outlets that we have out there at Traverse Mountain. Are they the exact same product that sold in the main stores, often times? No. If you have a retailer that's so focused on profits, profits, profits, profits, and sweeping every dime out of you, what is that going to do to you when you start looking at innovation? Will it impact you? Would you digitally cut quarters so you can have more profitable product? Maybe. Okay, well, what about prices? We talked a little bit about this. Who wants price? The retailer does. Once you sell a product, it's just like if you were to sell it on KSAW order, eBay, or whatever. Once you buy a product, it's yours. You can charge whatever you want. Even if it's marked with a suggested retail value, you don't have to charge that. You can charge ten times more if you want, or ten times less. So how critical is that relationship to try to influence the price? So you can maintain the perception of the brand quality. Who about promotions? Do retailers impact promotions? Do that. Just like price. 90% of all of this counts you see as floor are negotiate between the retailer and the brand. And choose the brand funding that negotiate. Funding that discount. We talked about that with Craig, right? About shelf placement. Who makes this decision? Retailers. Now we pay slotting to get in, right? The design guarantee is a spot. How important is that relationship? How about customer service? How important is your relationship with the vendor or with the retailer? When it comes to taking care of products, deficiencies, you create it. It's your bad. How important are retailers in solving those problems? To make any retailers shelf with warehousing, shipping? They can retailers out there that actually impact innovation. Can you think of an example of where a retailer is impacted innovation? One more came in last week and they were talking about how they were to create different skin colors. What was the mandate there when they did that? Walmart is cared about liking clothing. That's right. It helped brand them. But also, do you remember how long they got exclusive rights to it? One year. They weren't doing this with other retailers. This was an exclusive benefit to Walmart. Do you any of you, when you were a little kid, do you remember Toys of Rust? Yes. They used to love Toys of Rust. What I loved when it toys were asked is because I knew that some of those Toys of Rust were only action figures or for other families, barbies, that were only available at Toys of Rust. They were exclusive to them. When I was in industry, we would have retailers in our kitchen at Conagra, developing new flavors and new products just for this. So, can they impact innovation? I also tell you that thanks to retailers, when I was in the lottery category, it was thanks to a retailer kind of letting us give us a heads up to high positive coming out. And it gave us time to be able to develop a test strategy. Not ethical, but it did. In fact, you would be building their private labels why they do. You would be a good idea. What's that? Single dose bond retention. Really? Historically not at all. It's a majority. Yeah, I really think you guys are looking at that. Really? Yeah. You're looking at it. How about your team complaints? If any of you had a flaw in your product, you would have to get back to the store and end up getting more frustrated with the store than you did with the actual product itself. Isn't that nice that they don't really take that blow? It's true it happens. How about your crop ability? Do retailers impact this? Do suppliers impact this? Significance. So how important to see the channel? Incredibly important. So here's the thing that I want you to think about. When you do your four C's, do you really understand what those channel partners value? Do you know their language? Do you know their acronyms when you present? Do you know what they're measured against? Do you understand where their bonus structure lies? Do you understand their corporate objectives and what their corporation is trying to accomplish? If you don't, step back and dig further. Every retailer is going to value different things. And it's a covenant on us to ask those questions before you go and make a pitch. I'm going to use sold into a retailer before. Anybody? Okay, I will tell you, the more you understand them, the take a united we win, we category mentality, more likely you're going to get on shelf. So I don't have a retail example, but I work in a B2B sales. I work in different industries. And how retail, I mean your partner needs differently. One example that really brings very, very well is at AT&T. I was selling to the local government at higher education sector. And there's a lot of that you can basically have people that go out to the field. And they'll sell, they'll build partnerships and relationships with the city managers or the police department and they will sell for you. They'll sell for you and then you go both get paid. Like when I left, they think you had a really nice chat. And I didn't do anything. So I'm going to just pull through. Okay, here's, let me just fill this out of you. On this chart, here are some things that you as a manufacturer of my company. And what you might get measured again. And here's what retailers might own and what they get measured again. So let's say that you are working at a grocery school. Do you know if inventory is a critical issue for them? Remember the reading you guys had a chance to read? I'll pour this word in capital for some companies. Excuse me. If you know that going in, can you talk that language and help sell? But what happened about like, General? Anybody heard of General even before? Dancer would be so happy if I mentioned General. General is the gross margin return on inventory. It's a measure that we would use quite often in the industry. Because every dollar, every inch of space on the shelves and in that back room for inventory constantly, how quickly are you turning things for them? Is that important enough? If so, you don't want to talk about it. It could be dollars per square foot, dollars per associate. It could be a lot of things. But my point is here, if you're running these businesses, if you're working with these channels, are you asking these questions and do you know them? That's critical. Now, I could go for three days on channels. But next time we get together, we're going to talk a little bit about channels when it comes to impact the profitability. We're going to talk a lot about trade. Remember what we talked about trade on the P&L? We talked about, there's two types of trade. What are they? Flotting and cash discounts. How does a cash discount impact that relationship? What's the math behind that trade? Do you understand how that works? How they mark up against that price. Do you understand how to do that math? We're going to talk a little bit about that next time. Great discussion, everybody. Now, let's go."
