  "text": "it. That's pretty done in text. And I've recognized that. But I hope that the experience of kind of just really getting in and start switching it on it started to deal with a little bit of fruit. Here's what I believe in. I want you to learn how to find these stories in the data. And I also know that this type of repetition, this type of case that if you have a repetition of the procedure, this assignment that I gave you is the exact assignment that I would get every Monday. Every Monday. New ACNL, new Shukana data would start coming in. I need to be able to give my boss and overview of what's happening to the business in a nice clear, simple way. And so this type of work, and I'll tell you the first time that I did it, it probably took me close to a day. How many days took eight hours? Thanks a lot. How many days took it? How many? How many took less than six hours? There's some. Any way to take less than hour? No, right. I will tell you. I will tell you that this stuff, this type of assignment took me 15 minutes. Because you learned it, right? You know, you learn what's important, what's not important. You learn kind of how to break things down, how to simple crack things. But that experience only happens to repetition. Yeah, please age. Typically, would you do that and give it back to your boss in a one-page manner, or do this slide deck, or is it usually... I do a quick email. I do a quick email. Email, I'd be like, think about a half a page mail. And because my boss was so familiar with the business, he or she would be able to understand my jargon. So here's what I'm going to fill out at me. If you handed in your assignment on time, remember, if you haven't turned it in, you can still turn it in, but what's the deduction? 10% every day. Every time it is. But if you've turned it in, I'm going to throw this out at you. I want you to learn how to do it. So I'll let you rest after you get feedback. I'll let you rest in on a different brand. And you can do it again. And if you get max points, it's great to get max points. That's that a deal. And you didn't do great on the second submission great. If you want to do it again, great. So, if you get max points, is it only assignment that I do this? But the repetition enables you to be able to find the story. Finding inside of this game is really important. Okay? It will be similar assignment in the future. There will be different assignments. I don't think we have any other assignments that are quite like this. Okay? Is that fair? Yes. Well, I'll tell you, I had somebody a couple of years ago to be missing my brand management class at least to each staff. And they, percent, they got 50%. Not great. Then they went and they did it again and they got 80%. I was like, hey, you locked up nice job. And I said, how long did you get the first sentence? How long did this improve? Like, okay. And I said, if you want to do it again, go for it. So we did it again. We've got it powered. So, we've got a knife. He's like, oh, I can't do it this time. Did it again? He's dead. And this time, we'll do it in about 20 minutes. So, if you're up for work, if you want to do it, please feel that option is available to you. I will allow you to resubmit until Thanksgiving. Pephyr, you have plenty of time if you want to resubmit your can on it. You know, that's what the FXC2 is. Pephyr? No, don't be used to this. It's the other time that I do that, so I'm excited. But, yeah, I know the one thing I learned here. All right? Okay. So that's the opposite. Any other nails before we get started today? Yes, please. The MBA Association Finance Guy has asked everybody to please pay their dues. If you have extended ending circumstances, please let me know. And there's other options. But it's on the, like, just search BYU club, search up MBA. You can pay them. It's 100 bucks for two years. So, otherwise, I'll come find you individually. And I don't want to end up that. So... You can, I want four six. That's fine. Hey, any other nails? All right. Let's get started. Last time, I apologize to my boys and little rascal Adam look a little bit creepy. But I apologize. Last time we were together, we had a chance to walk through Marker Research. We talked about the two basic types of Marker Research. Just simplify. What are the two types? Primary and secondary. Secondary. What's primary? You go through a specific, we've learned about a specific thing. Secondary is, it's already been done. You're just going to use it and see if you can leverage some of these types. Do you get those internally and externally, etc.? The ACNL sub data. What type of research is that? Secondary research. So, we talked about secondary and we talked about the primary. Within primary, there's three common buckets. First one is, don't the score more, how to help us? We talked about the different examples. The second one is, now you validate with numbers behind it. That's going to be scripted. Now we're doing a survey, the call tricks, and things like that. What do we learn about AI? What's the beauty of AI now? You can do artificial customers, which is really, really cool, which enables you hypothesize how people might act. What else can you do? Before we learn how to do something like that. And it can also, you know, have to call it a new survey. That's right. Now instead of bike following, I'm going out and interviewing 8 people today. Now, I can have 8,000 my clients interviewing 8 times a day. And so, from a budget perspective, the amount of quality and the quantity of quality is really good. Skyrocketing is an option. But, or if any of you are interested in that world, oh, what a great time to be able to go out there and start exploring. So, we talked about those. Then we started talking about the most rigorous, and those are the ones we call experimental models or simulations. And we did the exactly heat map. Remember, with the difference between the eyes of that app. So, we talked about that. We also went in depth, and we started going into secondary market research and talking about the food and what, the where, the where, the why, to get to the why, or ACE and Y, and it's a kind of data. And we talked about that in the last few checks, you homework. Now, just to show you that I'm not teaching you false doctrine, I'm going to show you my actual notes from Monday morning when I got to work. So, I got to work at one of the ReCaliber's business, and I pull up my Monday morning IRI, ACE-NIS. And this is what I think. You can see two of the letter app. Here it is. So, my four week IRI summary from ReCaliber's single-sale business. Okay? Happen million in sale. Or, half a billion in sale. In a four week period, versus year ago, I am down 147,000 cases. Now, I have eight units in every case. How many units of my down, in a month period, versus the year ago? Well, I'm close to a million cases, a million units down. Guess how much I was planning on being down? Zero. In fact, I was supposed to be up there. So, that was my Monday morning. Can you imagine getting to the office, pulling up ACE-NIS, IRI, and planning out for this? How many of you are looking forward to the next little bit? I think I said your boss. Your boss is going to care. Yeah. So, you're just going to go and be surprised. Really? We're doing that, right? Oh, get right to it. Are you going to do that? No, what are you going to do? We're going to do that. You got to figure out what. So, when you start diving, you start doing custom rules. I taught you, in order to be able to dive in those performance, what's the easy first step? You divided into two key buckets. Where are they? Base volume. Base volume, which is what? Volume that is... Just regular price. Or regular price. And incremental volume. Now promoted volume. Not realist. It's realist. So, that's what I did. Look at how I found. So, what am I seeing here? What do you get to me? What do you see here? You're incremental. It's not as effective. So, sales or well-emotion. That's right. So, last year when I did it, I sold 147,000, a million units more in the same time period on sale than I did this year. Holy cow. So, we start paying back the money. Now, one thing that I knew because I've done this a whole bunch of times prior to this, is I knew that most sales all sales are tied to specific retail. We don't generally do a blanket sale across all of America. I'm doing something at Walmart, something at Target, and they might differ. So, I went to... Where? So, I said, okay, I'm going to go and I don't look at the key retailers. I'm going to analyze and find out who is down. And this is what I found. So, crore is my huge... That's the big problem. 66% of my volume loss is at crore alone. Aho, which is a conglomeration of a bunch of retailers in the England like Stop and Shop, a bunch of those different brands, those on down third. If I take care of these two customers alone, I'll be able to figure out what I've done. Okay? Stater, there's another one down 14, and Publix, then a Florida, that's 8% of my business. Alright, next, I say, okay, let's peel back the onion. If my incremental is on the threats and things aren't working there, we talked about things that it might be. What could have done it? What was one of them? The quality. Maybe this year I'm only offering a yellow tag discount. Last year I had a feature and a display. They were advertising and we had a special display at the show. What else could it be? I have the quantity of how long you've had a sale going. Maybe last year and that four weeks it was on sale at crore for two weeks and this time it's only one. That would make a big difference, right? What else? Maybe Stofer was almost so unsailed this year. Maybe there's some competitive action going on, but I wasn't anticipating. Is that right? Or the other? Okay, that's good. So that's what I checked into. And what I found is, crore, I had one last week, instead of two weeks, I had one week of discounts. And I lost a feature as well. So in non-promoted week of discount, I lost. I wasn't supposed to lose any. I found out that particularly at Stop and Shop in Boston and in China, and over in Pennsylvania, I had a week and a half less feature. And so the next thing I did was I thought, okay, you've got probably two retailers where I do. Before this launch, I had really open communications with our sales team to make sure that we had a short flow of those discounts we're going to be. And this was all in fact this year. Okay, this is in September, August is September time for you. So I reached out to my, the same guy that I told you about with the Popeye, his word calendar, and reached out to Mark. I said, Mark, we've got a little challenge on our volume because, oh, you're looking at IRI right now and I go, yeah, it's, yeah. I'm so sorry about that. I go, okay, I said, are we okay? Because, yeah, we're going to be fine. I'm like, okay, I said, what happened? And he said, you know how back to school sometimes does weird things when it comes to Labor Day? Sometimes it's before Labor Day, sometimes it's after Labor Day. Because all we have going on here, Mike, is the flow of the time of the school started. Last year, they had school start right before Labor Day, so we had two weeks of August before school sales. This year, we have only a week before Labor Day and a week after Labor Day, because school starts after Labor Day this time. So, in your month, August, you're going to show you how a week less of sales. Now, next month, you're going to see that action month. So, everything you're down this month, you're going to get back next month. You're confident, yes, I'm confident. Okay, now what does my discussions like to my boss? Much better. Much better. Now, what do you say to your boss when you see this? We saw major draw ups, but it's because of the differences between different time frames, schools on one kind of schedule, IRI is on different four weeks schedule. So, we're going to see the increase from the sales across two of the four different sets as well. Very good. So, we're just going to say, hey boss, hey, when you look at IRI, you're going to see numbers that don't look good, don't worry. It's all a time issue or promotion. Everything we are down this month will get in every step. I promise you. Very simple. In a realistic setting, how much time do you know we have between getting these numbers when we're going to be in your half of the season? Half an hour. In terms of your mechanisms to identify all of these mechanisms that you're going to be in. I mean, I assume you have these all the best of the boys who are going to see the future. Yeah, yeah. So, like, Mark, he's just in the office, he's down there, I'm talking with him all the time. But this is a tool that I've learned how to pull, customize, always different things to like, dig deep to try to understand what. What can you do to make sure that he's easy to see? They should have been seen and that's why Mark is politics. He's like, I'm sorry. And when we talk about it, he goes, hey, I just forgot the time. That's all it was. And so it goes, our bad, he goes, don't worry, we'll be fine. Like, okay, yeah, please. I'm just double checking, I missed anything in the 18 years of research. But like, the one week left, expect like all that. Yeah, so that's all just intrinsic knowledge that you know, that's not the data. So that's something I could do on a custom poll that you couldn't do on the big poll. Yours was all based off of dollars. Right. Mine I could actually get down to the week of how many weeks was there. So that was customized there. Now, after doing this assignment, I went to, you have, you have people from the middle of the school and Chicago, and they're actually in your offices. And they will be able to help you with custom boards if you need to be. As a marketer running these businesses, I do custom polls like this all the time, especially as a business bread manager. And so, when I get in here, I'm going to show you what I did after this. When I got done, I went to, I went to my person internally, and I said, I said, Jackie said, I did this really good. I told her what happened, walked her through my nose. I said, is there any way we can automate this to make it easier for me? She goes, what do you mean? So I walked her through this idea of kind of how I throw it down, and see if she can kind of build this custom or fork that we could utilize going forward. So this is what we use going forward. So what I did is we had this pull tab, and we could say, I'm going to look at it in four weeks, one week, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks. You tell me, if you want to look back quarter, you can. You want to look back half a year for a while. So I can do this. I can tell by what market I can say, total US, total drug, total grocery, total mass, crogr specific, smith specific, Utah Valley specific. We can do all those things here and dig down. And then I could look at what business I wanted to. I could look at it for all my single served business, Popeyes and dinners together. I could do it just for Popeyes. I could get down to the specific skew if I wanted to. And so we just pull this up really quickly there. And then once you pull it up, check this out. This is what I'm getting. Okay, recognize that number. That's what I just showed you. And look what then she was able to make for me. Here's incremental, here's base. Now my math is done. I know what percentage done. Here's incremental. What fuels incremental? Notice feature displayed. Feature TVRs down here. We're talking base price distribution. Okay, but when I go and understand why this is down by so much, I hear here's the big one. 70. Well, here's why. Down this works. So I share this with you. Just again, you work with big fortune 100 companies just because you do. It doesn't mean that they've got everything figured out. And so you can do things like this. This had it up. We ended up using this across every business with Connect. It's just as nice as your weight so that your eight hour exercise can be done in 30 seconds. Then you just have to work on your own. Does that make sense? Okay. Again, I hope that this experience at being able to kind of diagnose this action, and you should understand how to peel back the other thing a little bit. You should understand your brands, your businesses performance. Alright, let's keep going. Today, today, we're going to go back to our business frame. Okay? You have a business question where you all will start? For C's. Good. For C's. Upbeat, consumer, competitors and channels. Good basic framework to make sure we're thinking about our business challenge holistically. Okay? Always start with your four C's. Go through the framework then what do you do? Say it loud, man, go back up. Go back up. You start making pricing decisions. If I do that, what's going to happen to my four C's? What's going to happen competitively? What's going to happen to the channel from a corporate perspective and so on? Now, what we're going to be doing over the next little bit is we're going to be diving into each one of these C's to make sure that you're looking at them holistically and in depth to you. To really make sure that you're in a good place before moving on to making choices. Okay? I want to start with this deep thought from the heart of war. Sun Su, who was a general in the Chinese armies, came up with some amazing insights that he collected over the years on how to fight effectively. And there's a lot of correlation in these wars in anything when we compete, whether it be in sports or in business or whatever it may be. So here's a couple deep thoughts that I want to share with you. The first, so it is said that if you know others and know yourself, you will not be in parallel in a hundred battles. So it's just teaching us the importance of doing our four C's. Company, ourselves, competition. If you do not know others but know yourself, you at least know your motivation and you at least know your strengths and weaknesses, you'll win one and you will lose one. If you do not know others and do not know yourself, you will be in parallel in every single battle. How important is that for us in business to know ourselves and know our competition? It's critical. And so we need to do that because those who know when to fight and would not to fight are victorious. My mom is a fifth grade teacher. She loves US history. That's when we learn it as kids. And one of the things that she would always teach me is her son, not Roachers. The bond Roachers were wild. I can still tell you all my states and cathedrals. Anyway. She would often talk about George Washington. And now the reason why he was such a great general was not because of all the battles that he won. But in all the battles that he was able to escape. That's what saved the union, is getting away from perilous competitive actions. So something we need to think about when it comes to our business. We need to think about them and us. So what do we need to know about company? Just really quick. Start to wonder about what are some things you want to know? Zach was one. Mark did. Good. Do you want to know what business we're in? Good. Great. Like capacity we have. Good. What capacity? Product square. Product square. How many different things are you doing? How are you doing from a KPI perspective? If you're scoring well, great. If you're not, then maybe you've got to fix some things. Good. Margin. Margin's good. Is that important? Good. Carolyn? Are you making value proposition? Good. How are you different relatives to everybody else? So what do I do? I want to know. I always said about what game are we playing? It's like what's the future vision? Is there a market that we want to be in that we can't? Do we understand the vision of the strategy laid out? Is that important to know before we start making our choices? Is it the brand or product? Of course. Great. No. Balance sheet. Thank you. Yes, one. Yeah. Is that important? What's your strategy? HR. Oh. It's really dark to me. It's awesome. Good. Others. Yes. Are we business, sales, like blind spots that we have? Yeah. Do you understand our blind spots? Is that important? Just out of curiosity. Gentlemen, learn from us. How many of your vision of your ability to interview has changed a little bit since you've started to practice? Yes. How many of you are, why is it good as you thought you were? Sometimes we have blind spots. Really important. Do others. Any other insights? Good overall. Good going. How is it just been asked if we've talked about our company values? Good. The company values. Yeah. Are there shared things that all of us should be rally around? I love you walk out here. Do we know what the varied schools values are? It's pasted right there for everyone to see. Why do you think that our dean is chosen to do that? Ella, let me throw it back at you. So that we're at all this occasion we come back to share the information. Does that matter when you're trying to run a big corporation? Yes. Look, we've done this. Remember when we did this exercise? How did you describe the health of business? On the back, we wrote down a really nice list of things that we would want to know. All of these things are critical. I'm going to teach you just a couple things really quick to hopefully make sure that you can review a couple things we've already done. Just make sure you're remembering these things. See company frameworks. Understand that sea a little bit more effectively. When we first introduced the hard business frameworks, we talked about what our roles were. We talked about our we cash cows, right? Are we dogs? Are we stars? Are we question marks? Just a simple framework to figure out our portfolio. We talked about leveraging swine. Where do we get strengths that we've been to this framework? In journal, therefore which sea? Always company. Strategy is garbage in, garbage out. If we don't take the time up front on doing some good robust analysis up front and we need these seas, really tough to create a solid strategy. You might look out and a lot of them you do. You might have a really good intuition which is fantastic. But also put your risks. Just be thoughtful, be careful. We've now had an opportunity to dive into ACMielsen. Can we learn about our company in ACMielsen? Significant things, right? And performance. One of the brand, a couple people mentioned this one right here, do our finances teach us a little bit about ourselves? Is that going to be important to understand sea company? Yes. We've got to look at ourselves. We don't want to have those blind spots. We want an accurate understanding of who we are. What we don't want to do is look at ourselves with rose colored glasses on when we shouldn't. And a lot of times our pride, the way we are, we think we're pretty good most of the time. And it's really important to get a good solid objective explanation of how we are. What we don't want to do is look like this. We don't want to go into a real, so fantastic. We don't want our preparation to be like this. So how do we avoid this? I'm not going to be like this. How do we avoid not looking at our business with rose colored glasses? What do you think we can do today? Good. From where? I'm going to throw this. Good job. You got it. No, that's good. Good. So consultants are going to be great when you get an objective. Not far from you. Other than that, I was having what they suggested. You can essentially change up what are we paying with these companies as well as getting it. Okay, excellent. Alex. Good. Can our customers sometimes teach us things about ourselves that we may not know? I remember one time I just started working with Kodagra and we had a customer meeting with Target. Was that the meeting with Target? And we were talking about our performance. We've done really well. We've been growing like, probably like, seven or eight percent. At Target, seven years, year over your sales. And we thought, this is really doing well. And I remember my boss asking a really important question. He said, hey, so we've had a successful year. What can, what do you think we can do to make it even better? What do you think from a competition where they're outperforming us in a way they work with you? What a great question. And the salesperson is like, oh, well. There's something that they do that you don't, that's really good. Here's something that you do that's really great that they don't really do. Like just kind of asking for it is really important to do. So be serious and ask. And don't hesitate. Now, there's another friend who went out there that I heated to earlier this mess work. Called the Kizzy 7S framework. It's a country with Kizzy, consulting group. And basically, when they're doing 4C analysis and they're looking at C company, this is a framework just to say, are you looking at it in depth or not? And so kind of like how we look at the 4C's, are you looking holistically, this one says, are you looking up and close? And so the first thing you do is you go out three asses. Well, do you understand the corporate strategy? You talk about the business agenda, etc. Do you understand the structure of the organization? Do you understand the systems that open the company has? Are you an S.H.P. or was work day, one of the pros and the cons of those different structures and systems? Are you a flat organization? Or are you really complex? Does that matter? Does everyone online, does everyone here in the organization understand what strategy is? Is there going to be a marketing saying too? The other one starts now looking at the people. We say, okay, do we have the actual skills that we need to be able to perform on two strategies and the challenges that we're facing? Do we have the staff that you're required? Does our style enable us to do this? Everybody that's on the HR side, you're looking at me and me and me and me. Really important. But are we, when we start looking at C company, or you're looking at this, but it's not, it shouldn't be. It kind of reminds me of CRN systems. Do you think about the social side of CRN? Do you think you're working right here at the very end healthy here? Okay. And then the thing that links all these together from the shared values. I'm putting all these things just for your studies. Just to make sure you understand what you're going to represent. The shared values where everything makes it. It's the why. It's the why we do what we do. And it enables us to hope we'll be able to step on it and get something just in the future. Okay. So that's all it. Now let's start pulling a little bit. The next tool that is really helpful is one that I'm sure many of you can get so excited about. How would you be able to look at that and go, yes, yes, excellent. Hey, is this a marketing tool? Yes. Yes. How important is a marketer to understand your financials? Criticers. So please, you want to move on. Okay. So this, I remember the first time I started working on my business at a Boston with a stack of papers, all of a sudden, he said, welcome to the business. Good to know that. That's a mocked up. And I looked at it on the back of the wall. Here we go. Now, I'm going to just tell you a little bit about me. When I did undergrad, remember I worked in, I was a general business emphasis in marketing. Didn't have specific majors back then, whatever. And went to Meloduca and started working on the brand management teams. Meloduca, I've learned to tell us, it was great. They didn't enable us to be able to see the finance, as a marketer. So I did some analytical assignments, but I did do a ton of analytics. So I was there. So when I came to my MBA program, I would be honest with you. I was really nervous when I was in your shoes, taking my first big analytical courses, because I just had to have a lot of reps. I was confident in my capabilities. I knew I could do it. And I did finance here at U.I.U. an undergrad, and it's fine. But I wasn't a quant job. That doesn't make sense. My friend, my best friend, he was an investment painter that I knew. He was a quant job. Every single analytical method, he threw up. He didn't even look like he was even paying attention to God. He would study for two hours at ACE this Sunday. I would study for eight hours and get a name like this. And if you'd feel that way, something just came a little bit in our natural. But before I studied it, before I got it, it was easier. I knew I could do it, just didn't have a spoiler. So when I started working at Cod Agro, and I worked on Kiptozee, and my first rotation, I really didn't get much PNL exposure again. Then I moved over to the banquet brand. And now I got $700 billion from my responsibility. And if I didn't get my numbers, I'd aggro me not have its numbers. And so all of a sudden, my capability is to understand analytics and the financials behind the brand became incredibly important. So I started going in very early, knowing that this was something I had to work on. I went in early, usually get around there at 7.30 and have about a half an hour, two an hour of fun and enjoy a few times. And I worked a lot on it. I just do analytics and practice, and who's myself. I was getting it. I could give you a verbatim of what PNL was. And I couldn't think it yet. And I was not frustrated. So anyway, one weekend, just after I started doing this, I went to church. And there are elders' core of leading. We were sitting there and they had this really nice discussion about the Book of Mormon and the Scriptures. And there are elders' core of the Presley said, Brother, he said, if you're not liking the Scriptures under yourself or you're studying, you're doing your homework. And I could evolve her now, right? We've all heard that, and it's like, can't it? And then, a little voice in my mind, just one like. Have you been liking the PNL? I thought to myself, no. And I just kind of evolved back and all of that. I didn't think about it. Till the next morning, and I'm there, I'm working with PNL and that same repression in my life, have you been liking the PNL yourself? I was like, what are you talking about? But I stopped this time, I really started looking at it. Why is it important liking things in yourselves? You think you're like the parables. They make sense based on your experience. Yeah. It makes life your experience. It's relatable. And when things are relatable, I'll say you can do it. I'll work back to you. I've never made the PNL or financial statements relatable to me. That's a mistake on my head. So I thought, okay, I'm just going to think about it. And I started looking at it and I started saying, how kind of relate this to myself? And all of a sudden, a little liking, and I'm like, oh, oh, okay. I started looking at it and I was like, oh yeah. Okay, fast forward. Three years later, I'm in a conference room with my student team and Ray and I have recalers. And I have my salesperson, Mark Arons, again, saying he goes, he goes, he goes, he goes, he goes, I'm thinking about getting a discount to Safeway. He goes, based off of our ROI, I think about an impact in PNL. So I said, well, this is what I would think. And I did a quick background on this. It should be probably worth this million. And he was like, he goes, yeah, that's what I'm getting to. He's like, okay, it feels great. He goes, can I get a report? I'm like, yeah, let's go ahead. So we did it. So, didn't think anything. It was literally a minute conversation at that in front of the team. When I got back to my office, I got a call from the vice president, R&D. She was in that meeting. She's a part of our steering team. Maybe it was Pam. Pam called me, she goes, he might be in that meeting. You and Mark were talking about PNL. I said, yeah. She was, it sounded like you knew what you were talking about. I was like, oh, a little bit. She said, she goes, well, she was, you promised she would tell anybody else in Twitter. I'm like, she was, she was Mike on VP and I on PNL and I had no idea what this thing does. She was, would you come over to? I was like, sure. So I actually got a folder in my desk. I said, I'll bring it over to you. I showed you what I had some hahas in it. So I ran over and I caught her my hahas. And she said, oh my gosh, I did it. This is great. She goes, would you give me a favor? She goes, next Friday we're having a big meeting with all of our group of scientists. Would you two send them up to PNL? Sure. I mean, you do that. So the next Friday I've got 100-foot scientists right here and I walk you through the green field. And when I get done, I look out to my desk. I got another phone call. This time the vice president of HR. Mike, we heard that you gave this awesome phone call. Would you do that for HR? Sure. The next Friday I'm teaching all of HR. And when you got done with HR, you're beginning with Mike. Every month we have all new employees coming to Canada for a big order. Would you be willing to teach everybody to employ you about the PNL? Sure. Okay, so I share this with you to build confidence. Okay? If they need to be nervous about the PNL, it's okay. You just have to like it when you're into yourself. Either 1227, what is that? Sure. Give it to me. Yeah, James A. Little Lutter. I share one of the number of weekends. But they might be humble. It's great suspicion for all who humble themselves before me. If you're just to humble yourselves before me and you'll think of me, I will make. We will see if you can trust her. Okay? I believe in you through 1227. Now I wish I could say it worked on everything for me. But it sure helped me with the PNL. Now, do I want to learn my ah-haw? So we're going to break down. It's really simple. I believe you need a whole budget for it. Look around. Everybody, give them up. If you make a budget for yourself, look around. Almost all of you. 80% of you. Okay, I know this is going to be really hard. Where do you start when you make your own budget? That's probably going to come. I'm not going to buy that. Probably one of my friends. Alright, so you got to get your job. Good. Now, for you, soon it's going to be your salary. That's going to be a great place. Before this, it's going to be hourly. Will you take another hour, find your wage, and then I'll help you generate your salary. Right? Very soon. Now, can you make all that money? No, what happened? Go. Go. Make out my taxes. Just try it out. Yeah, I want you to set that up. It's going to be good and honorable since I have to pay the play. If I want to be an American, I've got to pay the play. Is that fair? Thanks. It's a blank share. I can't get too much. Yeah, we got money. Not quite. It's not all together. I'm going to call my take on pay. Okay, people all that. Very simple. Now, you have to, in order to live, you got to pay for something. So, where are some things you have to pay for? Where are you going to live? Why? Writh. Sure is. Why? Not at least. Are you a veteran? Yeah. You can get it. That's a little bit better. Say why. Oh, I love your words. What else? Food. Food. Good. Sure. Yeah, it's looking pretty strange. All of that to pay. Food. We're in a sure and extransportation. All of those will be all fine. I would call this. I'm going to take out the things that I have to pay to cost the living. Okay? So, might as well cost the living. There we got that. Really tough. So far, huh? Made money. Made taxes. I'm going to pay bills. Oh, what? We're going to get that? You actually get that. Hey, now I'm going to say, well, first off, I want you to know these slides that I'm showing you and the exact slides that I should show people kind of. Exactly. I haven't changed them a bit. And so because of that, you want to see Ty do not hear. So please don't say it and I'm just trying to teach false documents. I'll let you decide if you want to pay off the top line or the bottom line. I'll let you decide if you want to pay off the top line or the bottom line. Now, you as a consumer, do you get paid for it? You're going to make some choices now. So now I'll make all this money. Mine up. Okay? Now, if you're smart, what do you do with that? You think it's the future. You're going to say that you're invested in all those different things. And then, when you get done, now you got your fund money. Now you can go golf. Do you? Do you? I got it out of the cup. I'll let you know when you get in. You have to do by the way. You've got it. Okay. Does this look somewhat similar to what you would do on your budget? How many of you looks pretty cool? Or my gang? But the thinking's about the same, right? You got the cost of being a good-nobrall citizen. You got the cost just to live. You got the future investments. So then you got the funds. That's pretty fair. Yeah. It's pretty fair except down to get for that corporation's big taxes at the end of the process. And we pay the taxes at the beginning. Run for fate. I agree. And when you do run, can I talk to you about being tax-run with value-roaching property? It's not real estate. Okay. We'll talk about it. We'll bring it over to the next thing. Okay. How would you feel comfortable when I hear with this? Is this like mystery or is this pretty simple? Okay. Congratulations. You just want to learn to piano. That's it. You did. If you can think through that, you just learn to piano. How many of you don't believe me? That's too much. Let's talk to that. Now, here's what I shared with all the folks at the time. Okay. Would you know here? All right. All right. Now, I'm going to use a little bit of different terminology now, but the ideas are very similar. Okay. Now, I want to make sure that I make this note. As marketers, unless you're in the sea suite, you are generally going to be looking at your budgets, your property law statement, on a smaller scale segment than the financial statements you learn here in business school. That's why I'm separate. These are separate documents. All of these will be added together and laddered up where they'll pay their taxes at the end. Do brands pay taxes like we do as consumers? No. But it would be surprised that there's still some things we have to pay to play. Okay. So let's watch this. Instead of salary, what we're going to do is we're going to call this gross sales. Now, gross, that term, just think it's always gross how much money you have before you start taking people away from you. Gross is always the top line number. I think it gross sales, gross profits. It's a top line number. Okay. Now, gross sales is just like if you're doing it in an hourly wage. Okay. You've got the number of hours your sales times the price or the times the number of hours or the salaries you give you, the dollars get awarded. Okay. So I'm going to figure that out. That's going to be gross sales, my top line sales. Okay. Really easy flight, gross salary. Okay. All of that. Yeah. Now, the next one is where things get a little bit trickier. But the objective that the overall your margin, the opponent, still the same as what we talked about in the taxes before. The next line we take out is trade. Now, in many businesses, not all, but in many businesses you're going to be working with partners to help sell your business services. The partners that actually sell the products for you, like retailers, for example, you work with Amazon, or you work with Kroger, or Walmart, or Costco, or wherever. Those retailers are the world in which they live. Just like how we live in the United States and have to pay to play to be good and honorable citizens, there are some payments that we can make as brands as products to show that we're a good, not-able citizen in the community of the retail space in which we live. What is it that retailers care about? You talk to Walmart right now, or even better talk to Target. What's Target concerned about? Brands. Was that cost-resure good? Brand? The brand-resure good. Customers, yeah. Amazon, yeah. Walmart, yeah. They're worried about Alaska. But at the end of the day, if you want to simplify it, they want more people to come into their doors more than Walmart. They care about share. They want to make sure that you're more people are buying their business services than they want you to go. That's the one, yeah. So I can see trade, for example, for CPG and retailers. Let's say software. What is my trade-god? Just my channels, or maybe commissions for sales people that work back in it. It depends. Most of the time, when it comes to like PDS, I usually won't have a trade line. Okay. There will be some categories where things are on sale a lot, and trade percentage of those sales is huge. And then there's some categories where they're not on sale where Alphard's trade line is not good. So trade is composed of two areas. And both of these areas are going to help me be a good partner, to be a good citizen within that world for the retail. So trade is composed of two components. One is something called swatching. And two, something called dash discounts. Okay. One of the biggest resources and resource constraints that retailers, brick and mortar retailers have is their shelf space. If they've got a product that's doing really well in a shelf space, and everything in the category is really healthy, but all of a sudden this new brand comes on today. We just introduced this new product. You need to take it. What do you take a shot at? And you're the buyer. What are you going to say? How willing are you going to be able to take a chance on an unproven commodity and get rid of something because you're on the space to expand it? Get rid of something that is already doing okay. What are you going to do? How many of you are going to take that risk? How many of you have been hesitant to take the risk on an unproven commodity? Yeah, look at that. And that's what happens. Can you blame the retailer? What happens if they listen to that brand manager, they invite that new product onto their shelf, and then that product is a sneaker and doesn't move? You just lost out on a lot of profitability on the old product. Can you blame them for not being hesitant to do that? And how often do corporations come out with new products? Powerfully. All the time. So think about the constant pressure you're giving as a retail. So what do you do? As a manufacturer, I'm going to be a good citizen. And I say, okay, Mr. and Mrs. Retailer, I'll make you deal. I am so confident in this, and I've done research. I'm so confident that this new product based on an insight we've learned about consumers is so good. And so much better than what you have right now. I'll put my money where my mouth is. I'll give you $100,000 just to give me a chunk. And if it doesn't work, you get to keep that $100,000. And if it doesn't work, you can keep me off and still keep that money. Give me six months, four months, whatever you need. And if it works, then keep me on if not you do. Now, if you're a retailer now and somebody offers you that, how many of you would listen? Yeah, are you out now? Now, you just hedge the bet. You just paid to play. Does that make sense? Is that something that you only have to pay the first time in training you with it? Generally. It's a one-time sneak. So products that were, like I think, in the red shed, where are you? Right? That positive, right? You only get moves. A lot of people buy that product. We probably made slotting on that back in 1943. Right? You have an end paid dollar. But any new variety that I come on with, like whole wheat pasta, right? That one, that's basically all right. Every size, every variety, every different UBC code requires slotting in most retailers. Yes. What does that look like? It's funny. What's the dollar value for? Great question. Whole wheat, probably early. Great question. So I will just tell you, in general, in grocery, if you wanted to get 100% ACV, what does that mean? Every dollar. Every dollar. Every dollar. Distribution everywhere. 100% of America where they sell can't pasta. Right. So everyone won't talk. If I add up all the individual mom and pop stores, the bigly wigglys, the bassies, the hormones, to the crovers, everyone. One skew, $1.75 million. One variety. What does that be done for? I agree with you. See why it's so hard because it's not too much for me. That's a really good hurdle for not too much for me. But if you want to get a hook set distribution, plan on spending about $1.75 million to get on the chest. That's not distribution. That's just slotting. That's slotting. That's getting you in. That's what I'll be. And you don't get to pick where you go. It's just like general admission. You can get in the door. And then they get to figure out where you're going to be sitting. So this is the buying shelf space in these stores. This gives me one space on the shelf. I don't know where it's going to be. I'm going to try to persuade them and influence them where it should be. But at the end of the day, it's their choice. And then presumably if it's successful enough and they're seeing returns, you can just stay as long as you want. You can stay as long as it's buying. Good. Yes. Right? What if I'm like trying to think like overnight it was yourself then I've been selling online. I'm killing it. And then I go to Walmart and I say, look, I've done this many sales. Can I do a shelf? Yeah. Great question. So can slotting me to go sheet it? Yes. But it hasn't happened very often. But I will tell you this, there is one major retail that doesn't charge slot. Costco. Two major retail. I think you're like right in the retail. Walmart. Walmart doesn't charge slot. Why do you think that they don't charge slot? Did you have to have a proven model? I swear for long. You have to have a proven model and then they also have really high standards of distribution. Basically, if we have returns you have to take them all back. They minimize pretty much all the risk but in return you get incredibly high distribution. So for them it doesn't hurt them. Good. What else do you want to add to it? I feel like they're big enough that they're going to carry a lot of love for it. They're bringing up people with past your product. They're just going to have a higher, it would make sense to just have a higher wealth threshold to get in and you're going to just say like because of this we can say no whatever we want and then you have it. They're going to throw a little back in here. So this is what I would say about Walmart. Walmart is a grown, incredibly conservative historically when it comes to the amount of varieties and products that we're using in the street. Generally, the only ones that are going to come in are the ones that are either proven or they trust you so well that they'll take a shot and take a chance on you. You generally don't see a lot of the latest incremental new products coming in at Walmart. You generally don't. But you do see them at Target and you do see them at Kroger. They're trying to differentiate themselves from Walmart. So having new and incoming varieties today is a lot. Walmart also says if you're willing to give us $500,000 to get our distribution, that means you've got a lot more money that I can take out of price. Why are you just giving this to me? That's a good question. So trade two types. That's the first one is slide and the second one is maybe that is the only price. So as a retailer, in order for me, if I'm a retailer, if I want people to stop going to Walmart and start coming to my store, one tool that's available that we as brand leaders can help with is sales. Discounts. And so what we can do to be a good and honorable citizen will say, hey Kroger, I know that you want to be able to entice new people to come in here and you want to delight them with that price and stories. How about if I give you a little discount? If we'll give you a discount, you promise to give that discount to your consumer. We pass that discount on. And later that, oh, yes, I do want to do that because that just tell me to give you people in the store. So what I'm doing is I'm giving them a sale. Now by law, in the lower 48, let's say I'm Snickers. Okay? Let's say I'm Snickers and I charge Kroger. I charge them $1 for a key size Snickers box. Okay? Have you got that? Kroger then turns around and says, okay, I'm going to charge consumers $1.49 for that key size K-N-Far. That's out of our right? Pretty close. Now, as a brand, let's say that my Snickers bar is coming in at $1.49, but what happens with Reese's and Hershey companies selling Reese's for $1.39? Remember we talked about competitive activity? I'm on easy-gills and IRI? Okay, Reese's. If we want them to change their price, what do we tell them to do? Say, please, Kroger, please, we'll just mark that off. Then we're done. Come on, you're doing it for Reese. What are they going to tell you? What do you get for me? Yes, in Count Sam, you want a discount? You give me a discount. That's what we do. So, across the water, the Lord of 48, everybody gets this whole couple less of price. By law, everybody gets big, big, big, big, to Walmart. It's the same less price. But by law, we also have a flexibility to do discounts. And so, what we can do is we can say, think, we'll wait a little while, sorry, you're not thinking about, you don't get a discount with Kroger, you do. So, I'm going to give you 10 cents off of, you can call this trade, off of that price. Okay, so instead of, we're going to charge a dollar, but it's almost like a rebate. Then we'll give you a rebate back on it. If you go ahead and sell it for $1.39, would you be willing? And that's how they work. That's how sales work. How many of you thought the retailers should just be really nice by discounting their product? About 90 or more percent of those discounts are not discounted by the retail. They also were just discounted by the brands, the products and the uses. Now, unless you see some matches of discount on the retail, then that's the every nice. So, for example, we'll just make more. So, we are selling them on a dollar. And if they sell them on a dollar, every nine, or so a month, we give them 10 cents back on every single one. In theory, that's the way it's supposed to work. Okay, yes, give your rebate. Does that make sense? And that guy, we refer to lovingly as trade. Now, did we make that guy? No. So, do we include that in gross sales? No. So, we have to discount it. Okay, so let's go back. So, I go out there and I bring in all the money, and then I'm going to pay some slide, or I get some discounts to retail. Okay. The money that I now take home as a retailer, is what I call net sales. Think about it, you're a hunter. You gather all the things that you've earned in your net, this is what you take home with you. When I fish, and I reach down with my net into the water, and I try to land that trout, the moment that I capture that trout, that net-soul water. I can't include that water as a part of the weight of my fish. Well, the only thing I take home is just the fish. That's where the weight is. Okay. So, I'm going to get rid of anything that's not really what I'm keeping. Okay, we call that net sales. That is you really take home paid to be net. Now, just like on the canal where I am my cost of living, now I'm going to take out what I call the costs of goods sold. These are the bills that you have to pay to produce your product. For a Snickers bar, I have to pay for choppy, peanuts, cardinal, nougat, corrugated boxes, all those different things. I have to pay for the line-time plant I have to. These costs are costs of goods sold. Anything that goes into the product, and to getting it to the retailer in which we sell it to, so transportation and warehousing, all those things are cost of goods sold. Does that make sense? We have to pay for six, no matter what. So, if I take out that I want to product costs and overhead and transportation warehouse, you know, or is what they call cost, cost of goods sold, I've now paid money and paid my bills. What do I have left over? My money. My money. In business, what do we call my money? Our profits. Good team player. So, profits or margin. Remember we talk SCLV? Remember that big M? Margin. What do we make? This is the top line, margin number, or it is gross. Okay? It's almost gross how much profit you have before you start taking more stuff away. Okay? Gross margin. Now, over here, once we add our money, what if we were smart, what did we do? We invested it. Because this is invested in ourselves. The brands invested themselves. And how do brands invest in themselves? Advertising. Advertising. Good. Do you remember a commercial that you watched as a little kid? They added air for a decade or two. And also, it's still in action in the buy something. Me too. There is a Heinz ketchup ad that influenced me when I was like five years old. But every time I buy ketchup, I think it's crazy. I worked at the place where we did Heinz ketchup. I never buy Heinz ketchup. Unless I was hosting somebody at my home. And I always had my hands kept. And I would quickly replace it with my Heinz ketchup. And that's just the way it works. That ad impacted me so much. Talk about a lot of different investments. Where are other investments when they come to brands? Research. They really are indeed. They worry about the development. Think about the research. What does research enable us to do? Actresses. To make it better. To make my own choices. To define your customer base. Whatever you have a product question, where do you always start? For the four seas. Market research. Does that make sense? So the investments that we put into research make better strategies. So the more we understand now is going to help us dwell into the future. So we take it out as a future investment. All of that. So there's advertising and promotion. And there's research. I just call it APR. Advertising promotion. And research. APR. Those are investments that are going to help my business going forward. Therefore, just like my investments in my college fund money, I'm taking that out of my brand. And when I have that taken out, now I've got my fund money. Now what I'll call fund money. This is what we call contribution margin. The reason why I call it my fund money is this is where I was at all the bonus. Contribution. Contribution, think about this. Remember this word. You paid your bills. You've invested everything. You've got this lump of money left over. Here's now what you are now contributing to the greater organization. Contribution. And here's my contribution to the greater corporation. Does that make sense? Okay. Now, as a brand manager, as a marketer, we generally stop here. Okay? Now, there are things that we still take out. S-G-N-A and other things that come out here, which will come down to our operating income. In this class, I'm going to have you stop where most of the marketers stop. And where they're posted. Is that fair? Okay. Those are the things that you can direct as a marketer. You can directly impact everything above that one. Questions and all. Yes. Sorry. So I'm interested in like the Roth stuff, right? So on my side, I love my Roth IRA. I love my Roth form. What can you do on the trade side? Especially when you start talking about rebate. Because it's not a true discount. Right? I'm going to parking lot back because you're right. It's not. I'm going to teach later on, I'm going to teach you what they really do. I'm talking in theory, that's what's happening. That's not what happens. All right. Good question. You're going the right way. Okay. So G-N-A, general, and administrative. Okay. And C-Net marketing contribution. I usually, your first one is the PC-M. That's what we called it. In all of our companies that I work with. PC-M product contributions margin. Okay. All right. Now, let me show you some really important indices that are also good. So what's the port at? We're just going to anchor anybody. There's the price of being a good and honorable citizen. You call that trade. Just like our taxes pay to play. There's the price of making the product and getting to the store. You call it cost of goods. It's a lot like our cost of living. There's a cost of doing future investments. Okay. You call it advertising promotion research. APR. Okay. Just like our future investments that we make. And then there's miscellaneous expenses. Again, I care about one, two, and three. All right. Now, the other key thing that you start living with is that you don't turn here. There's going to be some measurements in the season. You're going to look at your brand, your portfolio, to make sure that you're providing what the corporation needs. I'm going to show you the two most basic and ask you to remember what it's like. It's really simple. What is GM, what is that door? Gross margin. Gross margin. Not generally, but it also stands for general mortgage. Gross margin on the P&L. Okay. Now, the gross margin percentage means what percent of the profit the gross margin that I have? What percentage of the total money that I made do I get? Okay. Of all the dollars that I made, what percent do I get to keep? Not as profit. Okay. So, the equation is quite simple. I take my gross margin as the numerator, not the money that I made, or the money that I get to keep. Sorry. And I divide it by the amount that I made. Now, what did I make? Gross margin. Did I make gross sales? That's net sales. Or did I make net sales? What did I really make? Why? Because I'm still discounting. Look, if that goes over to the blue line, and he's got a coupon for a dollar off of, you know, the whole hog. Is he paying that $10 or is he paying $9? He's paying $9, right? So, we only count the dollars that we actually made. Okay? Blue line is only in count that is $9 made. Even though it was a $10 price tag, that coupon saved them a little bit. Does that make sense? So, you always, always, always divide by what they really pay. And that is net sales. What I was working for Bristol-Mire Squip, it was a huge issue in the drug farm industry, the year before I started working here, where corporations were giving gross sales dollars in that. And giving that to Wall Street, not reporting the net. And they weren't including so many of the discounts that they were giving. And it was a huge debacle. It led to a lot of changes in finance. So, we always divide it by net sales. Okay? So, what percentage of all the money that I really took home is being divided to keep. That's what it means. Okay? Now, the other one is very simple as well. This is known as the Product Contribution Margin percentage. What is Product Contribution Margin? It's the money we have left over after all evidence taken. Okay? So, same thing applies to the take the contribution margin on the top line, the numerator. And we're divided by what I really brought in. My net sales again. All of that. So, this one's telling me after all the money that I made and invested, here's a percent that I still have left over. Okay? Contribution divided by net sales. Always, always, always divide by net sales. Okay? The Dowl says we can start comparing product lines within your portfolio. So, you can figure out the portfolio for another competitor. All the way to the road to Sudan, it's that kind. Folks, will this help you better understand C company? Yeah. Can I encourage you to memorize this? I would love it. I thought you were going to Carolyn and I said, Carolyn, watching through your PL. And Carolyn Congress says, gross sales, my straight was net sales, my scops goes, give me gross margins. My SAPR gives me PCM. I would love it if you could do that. Okay? Please, push yourself within your teams. Great. Let's let BYU be known as the school that people know they're paid out. Okay? Let's go down to Randy Eglue here. And make sure that people understand that we're not just archiprapid majors, we are. Okay, thank you everybody. Applause."
