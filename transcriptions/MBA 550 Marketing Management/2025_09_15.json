  "text": "So I'm going to say it's the right thing to see all of you. I'll tell you, we have an interesting D-Day 16-A class. Especially that's the 18-A class in a three-year year. But I'll tell you, I'm so grateful for what we've been to in jobs. It was really cool, it was on Sunday, had a chance to go to church. And we had one of our young men who was his spare well. He could be heading out and going to board inclusion. But his talk is all about the atonement and what it's meant to be. And he was so personal and so great. He just got the spirit of his really amazing stuff. And then after that, he was excited, our primary program was being taught. So right after this amazing experience with this young man, he had all set of primary things. And you know, the kids start seeing these new songs that they just contribute. The message of the audience is that they're just new. When you look up and you see all the kids just singing and all the adult leaders, all the teachers just crying and the kids are crying. I look around, my wife's crying, I start to get almost done. But I just sat back and I thought, you know what? I sit in an experience like this on a Sunday. I did a chance to really focus on what mattered the most. And then you could prepare for the process, but the image you had during the chaos of the last few days. And where there's so much confusion, so much anger, hatred, and all of a sudden the girl will focus on what you do. And that's the message that our Savior gives. It just helps me appreciate the gospel. And so I hope all of you got a chance to review a little bit, to focus on what really matters, and that's the kind of thing the love we get on this project. So I hope all of you had a good week of year. You can donate yourself, you can be on a just big, always a home or a 3-8-2. So let's start the right way of the word for it. Anybody who wants to offer it today, glad thinking. My father and Heavenly are great for the opportunity to gather together before the mess of thou quess us with thy spirit that we may be able to edit by one by another, and that our ideas will lead to inspiring from conclusions and to save these things in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Okay, everybody, a couple of announcements to get us going is always. So first off, just a quick heads up, your first homework assignment is going to be coming this upcoming weekend. So how many of you have actually got online to take a sneak peek of what's coming? Good, if you haven't had that. This upcoming weekend, you're going to chance to be able to learn how to find in-city, inside big data. You're going to be able to dive into a real data set at a something called AC Nielsen. It's also known as IRI or NelsterCon. I've got to talk about them a little bit on them. We were talking about CRM databases. But it'll give you a chance to really find the stories behind the numbers. And that's, I don't care where you're going. If you're going to be in a large manure, if you're going to be in finance or marketing or supply chain and off, HR doesn't really matter to me. But learning how to find insight in numbers is critical. So please take some time and we'll give you a chance to practice a little bit. And there's a big first chance that that is in marketing in the first place. It makes sense to go business. All right. So keep an eye out on that. Now we're going to go into detail, giving all the information you need to be able to do that well on Wednesday. So keep your eye out for it. I'll give you a chance to be able to work with each other a little bit so you can learn from each other because I think it's easier that way. And then when it comes to the right, I think it'll just review. All right. So again, we'll go into more detail next time. All right. Now the next announcement is, we got some visitors here. We got some folks over here. We're going out. We're going out. We're going to be second. Stand up. Tell me to still spot yourself. Oh, sure. Eric Connover, just grew up in Highland, Utah. All this is just seven kids. Yes, sir. I'm served a mission in on DUDA. And then I want to be where you are to go from my undergrad business management. And most of the better and professional cells since then, be to be cells now considering an MBA potentially for like leadership development, people development moving into that. Yeah. Well welcome, congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. I'm on the cell lines from Spain. I bet anyone used on four to ten years ago that he's registered with you. My background is in the consultant and product management. I like to get in and be going to product management and do an AI limitations. Thanks. I'm Luke from April to me, telling them close by. It's our division in Bolivia. I'm actually doing my undergraduate here, so I have no professional experience as a brand. It's our own. It's a shame that we've been tasted to this like welcome. Welcome, Sean. Welcome, Sean. Welcome, Sean. Welcome. Thank you for getting the mic's class. All right. Any other nail service? What were you starting today? Yeah, please. Try to announce the... Are we any of you going to go for it? Yeah, so Thursday as part of the IRI assignment. We're going to on Thursday, Ling and I are going to do like a session where we can kind of help you a little bit more. I'll write it on the board, but it'll be here. All right. The room 28 from 5 to 630. So I'll just write it there. And I'll announce that on the flamethrower. Future on campus as well as campus. Any other nail service? Yeah. All right. Let's keep going. Last time, when we were together, we had a chance to talk a little bit about frameworks that we use in marketing strategy. And I taught you something that I hope all of you have already just internalized and got in your mind. Whenever you have a business question, where do you always always start? Well, we're going to see. Very good. Now, let's try again. We can get everybody. Whenever you have a business question, where do you always always start? For C. For C. What are the for C's? What's the first one? Nothing good. Nothing good. That can be one or something. Two or more customers. A sellover. A sellover. Competition. Good and channel. Good. What is channeling? Good.  The partners you work with, they can be suppliers. It might be a retail area where we're working with understanding them before we do our strategies critical. We want to make sure that they understand them very, very well. Good. All right. So we talked a little bit about some different frameworks. You talked about that initial part of the Harvard Business Framework. Okay? And really important things.  Now one of the things that we discussed on the sports season that there's one critical one that's really going to start helping us develop our first marketing choices. First, marketing strategy options. Which one of those cities is the most critical area we've forward to? Let's see. Put it right over here. Thank you. Consumer. Very good, Shumton. Okay. So we got consumer. We talked about in business. We often talk about the ones we see first to understand the four cities. Once we see first to understand, now we start asking really important questions. They ask about who, who is the new business? Who? Then what? Then how? Okay? Who, what, how? Four cities? Who, what, how? Everybody got that? Who, what, how? So we're going to build off of this C consumer. Right? We're going to build off this C. And now we're going to try to understand everything we can about different consumers that we might want to go for. Okay? Now, as we go through this, we had a chance to see that we do it already tentatively. Remember we did the Bose example here in class? If you want to understand the health of your business, you can simply just divide it into your four cities. We talked about the four cities are really good when it comes to energy prep. Shao, Jo, you talked a little bit about this. Tell me how the four cities are back in here. Why can't you use this again? Oh, I was just doing like, I don't know. Yeah, I was doing like case in the previous question with my wife. And then it was really helpful because it just helped my mindset lock in. Like what is important? And with all, like, understanding how before people become a interdependent, I also use end-to-wind-star-life product and analyze everything in the whole piece. And it's really important. Like, I use a framework and kind of practice and can get my logic going. And then once you start like, into that habit of analyzing the case, you don't really need to go into it. Well, now, one of my prior students who took, like, you used to teach brand management, I didn't teach the core. But one of my prior supply chain operations students, he drove me to the office. And I tell you how grateful I am for the four cities in my job. He goes, this helps me make sure that I think I'm not from school, but I mean, such a change in everything. Remember in our reading, one of the biggest challenges that we have is leaders is really being able to make sure that we're always remembering to look at things from a big picture perspective. Four cities enables us to do that. It's just a simple framework that's something that can help us say, okay, how have I considered how this might impact me? How would, how are my four cities, if I start thinking about it, if I make this choice, how is this going to impact what happens next? Are we considering, are we thinking big picture like we should? That's what the best strategic minds do. We're able to dive in, but we're also able to look back and say, okay, how is this going to impact this more broader landscape? So please, remember those four cities get them down. From there, we go into consumers and we start diving in and say, okay, of all the consumers, who could we do business with? Okay? Then we're going to notice a little bit more, who should we do business with? From there, once we understand who we're going to go for and what they, and more about them, now we're going to say, what do they need to hear? What's important to them? We call that position, what position they what we do. So we go who, second team targeting? What, what are we going to stand for in their minds? And then we're going to go into how? Okay, who, what, how? Think about it. You position, you can position yourself way beyond advertising. Average is a great tool, but that's not the only way we position our products. Okay? This is not that way. Okay? I look at John right here. Okay? John right now is marketing himself to me. John, what are you saying, right now, how do you position yourself? Well, from a clothing standpoint, Patagonia. Okay, very good. What do I want to do about John? Where in Patagonia? The finance firm. He's a granola. What else? Well, sustainable high quality brand. That's right. Great. They also raise up some way back, which is also my body. You know, it's all, it's all. When you see this right here, I'm going to get a little bit of a layback. That's right. Good. Okay, what else is in position? How does position yourself? He's on the front row, taking up. Good. What does that mean? I guess he's committed. He doesn't have a choice. This guy needs help. God, I can't have been in the front of the room. But if he didn't have seating arrangements, is that true? Yes. Good. What else? Yes. He's got a mustache. He does. Well, I mean, so that's going to say a lot of things. I would say for some, it's just, you know, it's bold. Like, he's not going to be homeless. That's right. I'm not everybody can do a stash. No. You should play kind of person. You get some mindfulness. Good. What else? How else does he mark it himself? Yes. Just like Perry's got a binder out, taking notes. It's like he's clear as a gauge. Good. He's thinking. Yeah, I mean, I picked on it because this is what he was doing. You sitting down here is really writing down some good notes. I'm looking at his page. He's already, he's very engaged. He is marking himself as a stellar MBA student. That's going to be a job. So, yeah. So, it's true. I didn't have to, I didn't have to listen to what he has to say. To know about his lawyer. I think just watch. How many interactions do you have with people where you are branding? Everyone. And Brandon's going to be really healthy. And so, you have to be very intentional and quick to scroll on how you mark it. So, if you say, I need to position myself this way because this future recruiters really cares about this. I'm going to be very purposeful on how I communicate with them. Or this consumer group that I want to work with, they really value this. I want to make sure that everything that I'm showing them that I'm relating to them is reinforcing that message. And so, think about how these four P's. This is the how. Every one of these P's should reinforce that positioning. Everything. And if you start disconnecting yourself and forgetting that, now all of a sudden it gets a little muddled and people don't know what you stand for. And so, think about the product choices we make. The color is that we put on our packaging. The quality of the product can be decided with best. All those different things, the copy that we have, every single thing that's on that product, those are things that position us. Think about where we place our product online. The decision trees that people are going to try to figure out, okay, if I click on this, where is that going? Does that potentially build your brand or take away from it? Is it too complex? It's too easy. What are you trying to say? Think about promotion. Obviously, that's easy. That's the arts and crafts that we have to talk about. Think about price. How does price impact your brand? Does it position you? Give it back. And so, we've got to be really thoughtful. You never remember all these things combined into a solid marketing strategy. First, understand who, what, how? And then, you've got to go and make the deal and get them into the business, and hopefully you can keep them in the business, and once you do that, you'll be reap the profits. Now, one thing that I want to make sure that all of you do is this is not where this strategy ends. In order for us to continue to retain our investment, how important is this for profitability perspective? It's critical. So, in order for us to be able to do this, we have to continue to the lack. Now, are you as consumers just static or you evolve over time? We always evolve. And so, as business leaders, we need to make sure that we're not just where they are. We're going to be where they're going to be. So, you've got to be thinking about this all the time. So, one of the most important things about this model you've got to remember is once you've made your strategic choice before you start all over again, it's a continuous movement. Whenever you make a choice on price, you have to look at and say, okay, how will this impact my foresees? If I make this tweak in my product, let's say I decided to do a pricing thing where people have been able to do it. And by piecemeal, now it's going to have to be a subscription model. Okay, how will that impact competition? How will that impact my consumer? How will that impact my company? You've got to be thinking about all of that. You have to use this to think about what's going to happen next. Now, just to show you how this works in the world, I'm going to give you an example for me. All of you know this brand? This is the sexy world of cop-pots. This is the brand, this is one of your businesses that I used to run. Okay? Now, one morning I'm in my office and I get a knock on my office and my sales director, Guy Benning, Mark Orange comes in. It's about 7.45 in the morning. You walk and then he goes, hey, can I bug you? And I said, yeah, sure. He said, come on in, he's just happy. I'm like, what's going on? And he said, Mike, he goes great news. He goes, I just got off the phone with somebody in Betonville. Walmart wants to give us an handicap freezer space in November for a lot of times. Okay, so, what is an handicap? What does that mean? What is the patient? It's not on in the aisle, it's on the main paragraph. Good, so it's not in the aisle. You don't have to go down the aisles where all the other products are. Just on the end of the aisle, you've seen those. See if I'll see those at Walmart and other stores. Dibbles are in-cats. I will tell you that we get about two times the movement on an handicap that we usually do in the main paragraph. So, I had to build this into my plan. My business plan never did not reflect this. My bonus does not reflect this. So if you hear that Walmart on the first cold month of the year is offering you an handicap, how are you going to react? How many of you are going to be excited? I was hearing you, you're touching my mind. I'm going to give my bonus. This is awesome. But whenever you have a business question, where do you always always start? So then automatically, because of practice and so much, I automatically start thinking, okay, we got a price decision, what's going to happen next? So I asked you, I asked Mark, I said, what are they asking for? You said, well, they want to do a buy one, give one for you. Okay? Now, as a consumer, how many of you would love that up? Yeah, a lot of us. How many of you buy a couple more? Yeah, for sure. But as a business leader, as someone that's responsible for the profitability, the P&L, the strategy of the spread, I start thinking for C's. Okay, I want you to kind of play with this company C. What are the things that I need to consider before proving this deal? What do you have the capacity to produce slices of ice to see? Good. So right now, so this is only a month and a half prior to the deal. So in a month and a half, can I get all the line time that I need to produce significant more now? Good. What else? Marge? Good, margins. It's a buy one, give one for you. Okay? Now all of a sudden, I'm going to be offered something and put half off. How profitable is that going to be for me? And then I'm going to step back and say, what's my role within the organization? Am I a profit driver or am I a volume driver? I will tell you, thank you with the cheap hot pies. There are volume drivers. There are the ones that help us all become more efficient in the plant line so we can become profitable. Marie Caledars, we're all about profitability. We have to make up for the low budget or for the low profits on bankrupt. So is this going to be on strategy for us? What other things you're going to consider? Yes. This might be a bit of a fan of the same thing. The kind of reputation going along a little bit better. Good. Could this potentially impact the way that consumers view our brand? What is it saying? It's cheaper. It's cheaper. It's more discount. Is that something we want to communicate? So let's go to the next week. Let's go consumer. How they can feel about it? Great. Good. But we also talked about cheaper. I will tell you, for the last three years, we've successfully been able to convince consumers that our product was worth $3. Okay? Now what are we going to communicate to them? We made too many, we need to get rid of them. Yeah, it could be. Maybe we're not as successful as we should. Is that communicating something? What else? It's worth half as much as it was before.  Do any of you remember what the sales are? How many of you remember sales that you actually pause buying until that sale comes back? A lot of us. Never tell you about that. So our product, you know, I've got six kids and our family, six boys. We go to a lot of little people. And so what we do is our kids love sports shirts. And I've learned something. I've learned that on Fourth of July weekend, over at... What's the grocery store? The grocery store by Chick-fil-A, Macy. On Fourth of July weekend, they offer the big power rate for $0.50 each. They're normally a dollar to $1.25. And so when that weekend gets, I back up the minimum. I am loading up the pallet and we summed that thing down. We stuff as much as we can in there. Because we'll put it down in our food storage and then every time we get low, we go grab another pallet. You know, I'm just going to put it out in the middle. We're supposed to do it. We remember that. Are there sales that you remember? Okay? Do you think that these consumers are going to remember this? What does that mean for next year? I can't expect that. Why they change their behavior. Maybe they not see the value anymore when it's regular products. Is that a risk to us from a business perspective? Any other things we have to consider? It could be customer acquisition, the money to cost. Could that? Yeah, this is going to potentially bring in new consumers to the market? Yes. Is that worth the risk? Maybe. Why do you have to do some research on that? But if you've got a brand that is typically hasn't been able to bring in new consumers to regular price and it takes a half off deal for them to come in, what are the odds of keeping them in when it goes back up? Probably. So I don't know. We have to do a little bit of research to find out. It's a good thing to think about. Okay? What about channel? Who's our channel partner here? Well, our good. What kind of channels could be affected? Good. Am I going to be able to get the peas and carrots and the chickens that I need in time for this big lift? I don't know. What to find out? Why do you think Walmart's doing this? It's a good point. Please, they're all customers. Yeah. Do you think this is going to help them differentiate themselves versus target? In fact. So I will tell you that I know Walmart that the person that runs that category is bonus year over year growth in safe stores. So they don't give you a bonus because they expanded their stores. They said, okay, let's assume we have a thousand stores, what percent growth did you see in your category within that same thousand stores? That's how they're bonus. What do you think this is going to do for that buyer? It's going to drive sales if you might be able to get buyer might get their bonus? Yes. So I understand why they're doing this. They're a fiscal year ends right after the, it's almost aligned by numbers right with the calendar year. This is the last digit for them to be able to get their bonus. And we're going to potentially help them. Yeah. What does that mean for next year? And I'm going to increase it again. I think they're going to want to do the same deal. I don't want to do that. And you think they might even want to go more. They see the risk. Okay, so let's talk about competition. I will tell you that I compete against Stofras. Okay, claim jumper, A&E's, double other brand. Stofras is my biggest competitor. How is this going to impact them? They're sales. It's going to significantly impact their sales. And they could respond to do a buy one, get one out, buy one, get one free as well. Yeah, everybody wants to do that. They don't want you to take your market share. That's right. And so if you just killed them in the most important kickoff month, do you think they're going to have to respond pretty quickly to the date? Are you able to give Wall Street what they promised? A guarantee they're going to retaliate. And historically, whenever we do deals, we only pull things down like 20%. What is this communicating to them when we're taking $50? They're all for what? Yeah, it comes. And what do you think that means they're going to do? Yeah. And then what's going to happen to the category if we do that? They're really stirring. Could we potentially inadvertently start a price war? Yes. And who's going to win there? It's your choice. Contemporary short-term. And tellers, that's man, I don't meant anything anymore on this. I'm going to take away your shell space. And they'll also indicate you're the righty one. Yeah, there's lots of questions. What's the response time for the competitors? How long do they have usually went to respond? It's a great question. On something like this, it depends on how early they find out. And usually they find out. So if I'm a buyer, and if I find out that we're encounters got a deal like that, I generally have a buddy, a salesperson that is close with me over at Stofers. And you think Walmart would like that somebody else to give a nice deal like that? To continue building categories? Oh, yeah. So they might say, hey, I'm not going to say who. You might want to put together a nice little promotion for us next month. Oh, really? Yep. It happens. And so sometimes a month is adequate. If you don't hear, it's a lot harder. It can be really tough. And then you have to wait till the next quarter for the following months. So, do you see the challenge here? Please, Alex. I'm just going to say, given the goal of the buyer to build their quarter, can you negotiate that one? That one gets one. Yeah, that's the key question. So let's go back. Actually, before we move to there, Bill, I'm going to go kind of along the line of it. It sounds like from this, it's Marie Calendr, who's taking the bullet. Not at all. Walmart, but Walmart's getting all that. Is that fair? Nothing after all. It's a Walmart. So at what point do you kind of negotiate? Like, okay, maybe we do a, we'll take a, if it's a 50% off, essentially at that point, we'll turn you like a different amount or something like that. Because that'll just like we're giving you by so much product, we're going to say in the price, you take part of the head of that 50% risk account. I think that's where, is this something I'd potentially negotiate with you? Maybe something that's going to be more strategic. Okay, so all this discussion that we have that one on in my mind, in about two seconds. Okay, so you just start thinking in these things and say, okay, and so what you do is you just go, Mark, thank you, that's awesome. I don't know if this is on strategy, here's why, X, Y, and Z. I worry about what it's going to do this category, and I don't think that's going to be a long-term link for Walmart. Let's go and explain the risk to them about the price for scenario. And let's see if we could just do, if they'll give us the same deal. And when we typically discount that at 20% off, and Mark glithing was like, no, try it. Anyone in Walmart said, okay, we'll do that. And so we were able to do it, and I got my bonus. So, I was like, do you see how the four Cs can work? Do you see how the four Cs, you can just start saying, okay, it's a framework. How has this been impact, the whole listing impact of the business? It's really simple, but it's very powerful. Please remember your four Cs. Okay, now today, what we do is I'm going to start this with a little scenario. Now, why don't you put yourself in the mind of another business leader, a marketing manager, and tell you a little story. Once by the time, it was a brand manager that was working for Coca-Cola company, and they got rotated onto the Sprite business. Now, Sprite, healthy business, it's been growing 3% annually for the last three to five years. Okay, kind of being growing with the population trends. So things have been doing nicely for Sprite. Healthy equity, consumers liked it, supply was great, retailers liked it, everybody was pretty happy. Okay, now, new fiscal year comes in. Get a new CEO who says, hey, we need to be more aggressive on our base brands. We need to be able to see if we can't get more growth out of them. I would like each one of you to go and see if you can get to a 6 to 7% growth rate next year. Okay, so we're going to double what you normally do. Now, it shouldn't be too hard. We haven't been asking you to grow for the last of the while. You've been growing with population changes, but now we need you to be more aggressive. So, the new brand manager takes this, and where do they always all start? Start a new season. Start a new season.  Start a looking at a lot of different things, for innovation, packaging, pricing, and team. And the channel deals all these different things they're thinking about. One of the things that kind of elevates is that they were doing their competition. They were noticing that one of the things that Sprite does, and that was probably their most close-in competitor, one of the things that Sprite is doing is they were constantly revamping their packaging. And as they talked with the consumers, and they talked to the retailers about that strategy, they found the retailers liked it because it was new. And people thought it was kind of fun. And consumers said, yeah, you can change the packaging. It actually looks kind of cool, and your brand will do that. So, they said, okay, so they started exploring that avenue. And they started doing market research on what if we could ask that Sprite. And everything that they heard from the consumer base was positive. They were like, yeah, you should do it. It's been 15 years since you've touched your packaging. Rebounded. Passed the bun. You're a fun brand. Do it. And so, the brand manager put the product a little bit more research here and there, and made the decision that they were going to try this out. So, she went to her manager, the director of the brand, and the director listened to the argument. And she said, you know what? I hear you. So, in my experience, a lot of times when it comes to packaging things, we don't get the return that we typically see from market research. A lot of times when consumers say they value, doesn't translate, and it just sails. It might sound fun, but it doesn't always work. How have you done this and this research? Brand manager, you know how to do that? She goes, okay, why do you go before making a decision? Why do you go and spend some money here in A&C? Let's go do some more thorough research. Let's make sure that this is actually in the trench fire. Brand manager said, you got it. When we did it, did all three rounds in the market research? Everything looked great. Okay? So, the brand manager goes to her boss. Boss is a good result. So, I'm really excited about this. We bring up tougher management so you can get approved. Boss looks at she goes, ah, I know what's saying this, but my gut just says this doesn't feel right. I don't think the consumer is even though the research says it. I don't know if they'll really get react this way. But, because you've done the research, well, L.A. So, the brand chopper management. Upper management listed the proposal. Upper management said, okay? This looks really good. Director, what do you think? Director says, I hear you, but. I'm sure. And they said, noted. We remember that, but based off what we've seen, let's go ahead and let's make a few. Let's take a little bit of risk. So, now you as an assistant brand manager going against your director's recommendation. And you're going to be now changing the packaging. You're ready to see the change? There it is right there. Okay? So, there's the change. The test goes with you so much. The consumer said, yeah, we love it. Chris, clean, edgy, we love it. It's great. Go. So, you'll watch. Now, when you know you're going against your boss, and this is your first big recommendation, how many of you are going to be very careful in watching your sales? I'm going to have to go on. All of this is good, right? So, that's what you should do. And, unfortunately, sales went down. So, instead of that 6 to 7 percent growth that they're hoping for, it went down 6 percent. So, no longer hoping normal value. Steve, this is not good. So, my question for you is this person that's over the brand. What would you do? So, one of the things we're going to do in this class is I like to get kind of a blind poll. What I do is I have you go like this, and when I draw the idea that you like, you're going to open your hand quietly. Okay? I'm going to give you two options. We're going to do a close-up. I'm going to give you two options. The first option is cut it, go back to what you've done to store it. Okay? You made a mistake? Let's just go back. Okay? Before it, but let's stop the averaging. Let's go. Are we closing it? Yeah, we're closing it. I'm telling you what the option is. Okay. I'm not doing it. I don't even have the right to look like this. The second one is, hey, we did the research. I believe in I have faith in this research. Let's hang tight. Let's keep going. Okay? Those are the two options. Okay? Everybody close your eyes? This time. All right. If you believe the manager, you should stop what you're doing and go back to the old packaging. Before it's too late, please open your hand. Okay. Are you good? Thank you. Go ahead and close it. If you believe that you should hang tight, trust in the research, and let's see what happens. Oh, that's great.  Almost 50-50. This I love. Okay. Those who say stop. Why? Disgusting. I like you. Tells how you're really good. I like you. I like you. Tells how you're really good.   What's the best of you? I like you. I just don't like the new packaging. It doesn't look good. Package you just doesn't seem to be good. Are you a sprite customer? I don't know. Let's say it comes through. What's the other way that I'm going to say it? Superhero. Superhero. That doesn't match the brand that I'm using. I think that's the best one. Superhero. I'm going to go back because this sprite is on. I think in general, this isn't like some of the drawings by the brand. And I think the general customer just doesn't have a pretty short memory span of this thing. It's like this. So it'd be more like, oh, those of you who are the sprite champions. That's when I know that I was created. Maybe it's a collector run. To be sure. I just don't think that. I don't think people would be like, oh my gosh, they're idiots. I'm not doing these writers, they have to grab their cans. I can do what kind of forgetting one. Okay, that's where it brought. I kind of would, along the same lines, I hypothesized, like in my mind, that maybe the market needs some time to react. You know, like people aren't recognizing they ask quick on the shelves. And once this becomes a little more familiar, or maybe some of our ads have the new packaging or something like that. So you're saying, let's hang tight. Yeah, maybe like an instant reaction, like you lose some recognition, and then, oh, it's like, oh, that's right. And, you know, maybe it catches up. Maybe there's at the lake. Okay, here, Jen, what were you saying? I, when you said that they did research on A, B, and C, why do we know that those were the right things to chat for? And also, did there some confirmation bias? Yeah, so a chance that we're looking for numbers that we want to see. Yeah, maybe. I mean, we've heard of the cracker barrel incident, the gap incident, the tropic can, and incident, and it's like, I think, reverting, and all three of those brands chose to revert back because it negatively impacted their sales over time. And I think that also shows like, hey, we're listening to you as a customer. So we're going to go back because you guys are familiar with that, and clearly you value that. Okay, thank you. So just like what crack, I, that during lunch, because I was eating my lunch, I saw on Facebook ad come up, was talking, showing all the cracker barrel signs going back to where they were and everybody was celebrating. We listened. I feel like there's probably some element of like growth rate by percent with population. Like there's some like nostalgic or familial components of those brands, rather than like, oh, this is a brand, I expect to change and I want to see them do that. I keep it off and it should be different. Are there, to your point, are there some brands that have permission to change frequently? That sounds like part of your brand? And other some brands that you just probably don't want to touch. Okay, I think it's a very good company. And Joseph. I have a great question to be like, hey, we, and if I, this was the concept of drop in sales, it's just like a bad idea. So you're saying, hey, do we really know that it's the packaging that's fueling the performance? Do we know that? I think these things, there's the fact that often, while you're on your market, and so I hold you, and so that, it's given me that a sound factor. But part of it to me, like, if you're targeting new and super, it's intimately your target and you're going to be super. And the other consumer now, I don't necessarily have a positive correlation with that. And so a lot of it is going to lie on, you know, parents who are accustomed to the brand, and using their kids, and if you take away what they can do, it's the brand that they're familiar with. That's kind of the fact that it's a migration of these things. So maybe those are trying to get the usual product, I'm going to be the five of us. Maybe that's impacting me, see? Good, others. I was just going to say they have a historic data to forecast the old predicts, what's going to happen. And then once they lose the market share, the competitors have been coming, and we're like, this is going to take over. And then I would suggest that they take them all back, and then hold the production, and just like to lay out a little bit of trial running in one air, and we'll see how that runs in the model in one. So let's go and say, we're going to recall almost all of it. This is what you're saying. We're going to recall almost every big of this market, you know, continue to test it there. What were you saying? Yeah. That's interesting. Please, Jared. I'm going to agree with that we should just say the course. Yeah. Makes it like what?  Well, so I would agree with Brad mostly, but isn't it very common that at least at the first people are going to not like a new branding, you know, and they're familiar that it's comfortable, whatever. And then any change is scary, right? And so even the brand you know you like, it just seems weird. And I know that the opposite there are incidents where people, you know, are outraged or pseudo outraged about the brand change. But I think there's a little brand trend to switch back a little too quickly, because they don't actually know what the lasting effect is. So you say, hey, look, just because we changed from Twitter to X, people did not like that. And people really like it now. Yeah, that's like, okay, yeah. Hold on. Right. Thank you. Thank you for coming. My manufacturers, I'm on the same line, but they've already run up a bunch of these. We have rented a bunch of cans already, so there's a lot of some costs to consider as well. And when we would sell costs. You keep going. He's taking it. He just taking it. He's taking it. Yeah, he's taking it. As far as looking towards a future, can we talk about just that design specificity? Well, that's a question. I mean, we have one. Jake said, hey, I don't think we should choose this. Yeah. This doesn't jive with me. I'm a Sprite user. This doesn't. Right. This is what I want to do. Is that the issue? If the packaging really is kind of what done it? If that really is the key driver for the decline in sales, could it be because of the design? Is that the perfect design? I'll tell you, the research, they showed that design. And the consumers have, oh, yeah, it's great. It's an element. It's different. It's a little different from like a cracker mirror or a java wire. It's not necessarily playing up brand identity like we're actually doing identity. It's a bit smaller recognition issue. It looks pretty different. So how we've promoted to change the whole brand and the potential consumers recognize it. It's a great, well, I'm pretty sure my driver still will use this. You know, I want to check in the strom under the best. It doesn't do. I still be okay here. My big thought of this as well is it's a very big change in the packaging. And I don't really recognize this change personally, but it also makes me wonder if people with the experience of the new coat are seeing a new brand of Sprite. Basically, I'm going to go, oh, they must have changed something. And they had that bag of drinks like new coat before when it was a sudden change. And there's a few doubtful. And so now the seven Sprites also changing even if it's just a packaging, they might not interpret it that way of just packaging changing. They might think that this is a new Sprite. So a new Sprite can. To Dell's point, how many of you would be a little nervous that maybe they didn't change more than just the package? Look at that. I'll tell you probably about eight years ago, Coca-Cola decided that they were going to do a Diet Coke special packaging offer. Or it was regular Coke special packaging offer during the holidays. You know during the holidays how they have the Coke polar bears? So they did all the packaging. What? They're the polar bears. And I will tell you, big consumers were curious. They started doing blind test tests showing that Coca-Cola changed their formulas. It was all over our mind. They hadn't changed the packaging. But a lot of consumers were worried about that. They were trying to pull away the ones. So to your point, Donald, I think that's a very, very, very, very simple. So you're going to throw this out. How does, do these types of things impact us in business? Yes. Okay. Are there times where we have to make judgment? Are there times where we have to make a strategic call without perfect knowledge all the time? So just hedge that back. What do we do? We do market research, right? Which is the framework for market research. Of course, these are the business. So there's a lot of different frameworks that are out there that can even help us better understand our four C's. There's frameworks to better understand C company. Okay. They have McKinsey 7-S. There's frameworks out there that help me better understand channel and competition.  Quarter-Spy Ports. These are all C's first to understand frameworks. And you'll learn, and we'll talk about when you do these. But at the end of the day, we're doing our best job just trying to make a good assumption. And that's going to help us fuel all these other areas here. Now, in business, when we start making these calls, in a lot of corporations, depending on the size of the company you're going to work with, you're going to be involved in some strategic calls and you won't be involved in others. So if you go to a lot of the big, big companies, the big fortune 100-500, the bigger companies you're going to look at this and say, Okay, after management, the boards, we're going to be defining these three areas. We're going to understand what we're trying to do is from a mission perspective. And you won't be doing that middle management for managers. We're going to be defining what success looks like, because we understand what Wall Street and our investors are expecting from this issue. We'll determine that not you. And we're going to look at our portfolio to make sure that we have what we need to get the growth for these. Those are the things generally that we won't play with coming right out of the MBA unless you're an entrepreneur. What they'll do is they'll say, okay, we've learned that in order for our Wall Street folks to be happy, or in order for our investors to be happy, we might say I'm going to just throw this out. A 4% growth is what's needed this year. Now what they're going to do is say, okay, 4% growth, we're going to throw it over the wall to middle management, that's us. And managers, you need to figure out how you can take your brands and grow it 4%. And this is pretty traditional, it happens quite often. Now, the corporate strategy folks, the people up above are going to be determining all those big things. So you think the folks over Google, you think the managers, the brand new MBAs are making this decision to split off from Google and go out with that? No problem, we know. What about the offerings that the dovey offer? The big view is brand managers, product managers are going to be playing this right out of the way. Right out, probably not. Pepsi, that's a big portfolio. Now, just not what you're asking, what brands, what product categories Pepsi are? Oh, Henry, drinks, chips, what else? That's it, drinks and chips. Snacks, breakfast, explain, quaker. How many of you do quakers from Dubai? That's a good one. That's pretty interesting. So, yeah, just to give you a perspective, the beverages, they've got a nice portfolio. Here's all your sodas, the ones you typically think about, how many of you do the Izzy came from here? Not that. Yeah, pretty fun. Let's go with it. How many of you did take it? Was the product now that's going to be the commercial line?  And then of course, gave it. Did I only know that this all came from one company? Yeah, somebody comes from the company. It's amazing how big the portfolio is going to be start looking at some products. And we're saying, definitely. Would it ever be a situation where I'm going to reveal my bias very strongly here? At what point is it negative for all of these businesses to be with Pesci? It's a kind of... Well, it's self, it's not. I mean, someone here named Pesci, but widely, it is not what I would say. People like that, I would say probably do more people like not using Pesci. That's a fair question. I'd like to give you a chance to see Pesci. You look at the growth of the market share, that's definitely what we're saying. Yeah, what are the... What are you going to get this a little bit later, just offline, offline? What are the pros of being in one group? Research? Resources. Good. Yeah, it comes with scale. Is it going to help you in your plants? More than likely, is it going to help you selling into retailers? More than likely. But you notice it's not Pesci's mountain dew. Okay, there's different marketing strategies used. There's a house of brand strategy and a brand of house strategy. We'll talk about that later in the semester. But there are risks, too. If you do decide that you're going to be Pesci's mountain dew, are there risks? Now, the sudden, just to your point, people say, I don't like Pesci. What happens if you have like an equal light sphere in one of your brands? It's nice not to be associated with all the ones that you typically hear from. So there's pros and cons. So there's pros and cons. So all these snacks, most of you know these brands? I don't know. You're like, believe it, you might be able to do it. How many of you sudden chips get to the same group? How about Dean Amitas? Yes, great product. I'm in a lot of trouble. I am too. Can I just tell you, having one of these Dean Amitas with a Slurpy on the back? I'm on a road trip.  It's my favorite Slurpy energy. And Dean's going to start. Alright. And then we've got package food. Okay? Here's your quake of renter. Actually, at one point, there also we had restaurant. Did you know that? Did you know one of them went to Taco Bell? It's all in one ride. They bought it. They were unwashed. Because they were unsuccessful getting Coca-Cola out of the restaurant. They tried to sell them PepsiCo and the restaurant's like, sorry, we're not going to do this. So they're fine with my eating. Did somebody get it? Did somebody get it? So that was tragic. They also realized that National Aditya was doing it. Doing the quick serve restaurant is very different than doing it in a small basket. So it's your soldier. Now we have the rest. So these are the strategic things that we need to... That's one of the things that they look at. Now, historically, old, old, old school. When business managers say, okay, we need 4% growth this year. Throw it over to middle management. Historically, everybody would need to grow by 4%. Now it's kind of the rule. Like hey, everyone's got to pull their way. Okay, we're all in this together. But the Boston Consulting Group, liquid, doesn't say, oh come on. There's some brands that can grow much faster than this, and you're not pushing them. And there's some brands that you're not going to get 4% out of. And so they said, before you start making strategy, let's look at your portfolio C company. And let's look at something and they called this. They developed this model called the Boston Consulting Group Matrix. Very simple. You may not know of this name that you'll recognize some of the terms of used. They wouldn't they say, oh, we look. We're going to look right here. We're going to look at this growth rate of the category. Right now, AI products associate with AI. Talk about growth, right? Block change. Talk about growth. There's a lot of technology areas where we get a lot of growth. There's other areas like chips that is probably not growing very much right now. It's in infants, it's in their mature stage of their life cycle. And so there's going to be some products going to be high and some that are going to be low. We're going to mark those in on this left axis, high and low. Now, the other thing we're going to look at is how is your brand performing in the category? If you've got a stellar brand that everybody's aware of, if you've got a high market share, whether it be dollar or volume, you can figure that out how you want to define it. But if you look at that, we're going to put you down here in this corner's high. And if you've got a low market share, you've seven minutes successful with some of the other big behemoth brands, we're going to put you in this quadrant, low. Now, with this now two by two matrix, we're going to create some generic categories. If you are in a high growth rate market, but you have a low share, let's say you haven't even launched a product yet, we're going to call this category question marks. Okay, there's potential. We don't know what it's going to be. All the way because there's a high growth rate, we'll be able to get in there. But we don't know. If you have a high share in a fast growing market place, we call you star. Now, not all categories are growing at a quick clip. And so there's going to be some where you have really good share of the categories not growing. This is like chips or sodas. We're going to call those cash cows. I'm sure all of you have heard cash cows. And then if you got a low share in a slow moving category, what would you call those? That's it. Those are the different categories that we can play from a generic perspective. Now, with this, as upper management comes along, we can say, okay, we're going to find our category based off of these performances and based off of these metrics. Right? So, do you think that all of these folks right here should be in the star categories? Historically, this is what they would have done. What would you have put maybe down in the stars? Is there any here that you might put in a star? My Cheetos, maybe? Maybe this one right here, maybe? Looking at 100% natural here, is 100% natural coming in right now? Grow right now, category? Maybe? Which ones are going to be cash cows? Almost all the rest. So, if we look at this from a different portfolio, using the BC growth majors, we're going to say, okay, we're going to expect maybe 3% growth, 2% growth here from this category. There's going to be other innovations that we're going to ask you grow more than 3% to help offset their lack of growth. I might ask them to develop digit growth, if they're innovative and we're investing in this. And then there's going to be some brands that might even be in a healthy portfolio like what PepsiCo has, where they have stuper dropples and topless. Okay, you've got major share growth players. But why would a healthy company potentially still keep a dog in their portfolio? Because they're named after it? They won't. The market trends have changed. Good. I've got a change in the market. Good. So, is there a chance that you see potential in a certain market and you're seeding some growth, you just haven't occurred yet and do you want to be able to play in that area? Hey, what else? Why else? Please, John. You might have low growth in the market, so you know the market might be pretty good. Good. Why is it that they're really profitable? Do you want to give it up? Do you want to give it up to something that's less profitable? Probably not the best choice. Why else? Yes, please, Mike. Sometimes a little bit of cannibalization is a good thing. It gets consumeristic thing. Oh, video priors are a little hard. And it drives me rich. Oh, that part sucks, but I know that you know, plays or whatever else is a little wide. Oh, you actually can reason. Good. Did you leverage some of your big dogs out across the world? Some of your smaller, upper-comers? Maybe. Good. What else? Operations folks, why would you potentially want to keep another product line in your line? Even though it's not a high-pitched share. Because of distribution channels? Could be a distribution channel issue? Maybe it's regional? Right? What things do varners, distribution partners? They're good. Might be a specific partner you need, others. Yeah, please. Could you say in this just to give you a shelf space on your competitors? Good. It's not. Do we ever consider that? Do we ever say, you know what? I'll play here. I don't want my competitor to play here. And I've got the shelf space and I don't want them to come steal it. You got ever happens? All the time. So what are regional, plant-tollness products? Could you consider that dog or a national? Yeah, if you look at it from the national perspective, yes. Could you potentially have a really high share growth product in a certain region that could be like a cash power star that wouldn't be if you look at it from the national perspective? You bet. And here's the other one. If you've got operational time on your planet, if you have capacity, do you want to fill that capacity? And sometimes they don't want to get that capacity up because of the other products in their line less properly. So there's a readme at all these different things. And you within your organization, you need to understand what your role is. Just like I knew Marie Calder's was supposed to be a profit driver. Do you understand what your role is? So those are some of the things that we've got. So the VZG growth matrix is one model that can be very helpful. Now, be careful of self-fulfilling prophecy. What does that mean? What does self-fulfilling prophecy mean? So it's kind of like saying, oh, I'm pretty sure this brand's a dog. So I'm not going to put anything into it. When VZ could actually be a star. Yeah, that's really, really good. I'm going to give you two stories to do this. Many of you know Unilever. Another brand has just tons and tons and tons of different brands. So Unilever, big company out of the UK, big company here. They have a mandate for they only will develop number one and number two players. That's it. When it comes to the VZG growth matrix, their philosophy is we're going to invest in cash cows, kind of. But we're going to really leverage and get the profitability from those cash cows to shore up and promote our, our, our restart. So that's what they do. So they look at their entire portfolio. And if you've got a brand like Sublider or a hero five that are a little bit older, they're going to take the profits of those and use that profits to shore up and bring something. Okay, so here's three brands right here that I'm going to do it. Whisk on Sublider. They decided that when they first came out with this, let's take Sublider as an example. If you look at the growth rate, if you look at the, the journey, the product journey, the VZG growth matrix from Sublider, about 30, 40 years ago, Proctor Gamble came up with a conditioning product called Bounce. Okay, all we know about is this was a, they put a little land on there and this is a dryer sheet that all of a sudden removed static clean. All right, so no longer your socks going to clean to your pants as you, as you fold. And it took off. Really nice business. Okay, so Unilever looked at this from Proctor Gamble and said, okay, we need to react. So they did some market research and talked about their consumers, they did their foresees. And they said, okay, we better not, the consumers don't just want, they don't just value the benefit of static clean. They also benefit, they find the value of just softer clothes and the fragrance that we've been sleeping on. And so they said, what if we went wheat throwing a little competition and they introduced snuggle, they said, okay, we're going to introduce this, this snuggle bear gets all about softness and fragrance. That's what we're going to be known for. So they landed at the beginning, they already questioned one. Now, did snuggle bear, did incredibly well. In fact, it got to the point where it was almost at 50-50 share. Some people love to static clean, other people love the softness. And so quickly, snuggle was no longer a question mark. The category was growing like crazy and now all of a sudden it became a star. Over time, the category stops growing as quickly as the adoption rate starts to slow down because most people are using it. Therefore, what does snuggle become? Now all of a sudden, snuggle was no longer cashed out. There are no longer stars now cashed out. And so now all of a sudden, the self-fulfillment prophecy comes into play at Unilever, where they have a mandate where it's a cash cow, we're going to treat you like a cash cow. Therefore, we're not going to invest in you like we used to. We'll let you a little bit, but not very much. And over the next 20 years, they milked this profitability from this brand to that. They stopped investing in any kind of market research. They stopped investing in any type of advertising, but minimal advertising. No one makes you and year over year snuggle, who was doing great at the time, started taking it and taking it over by advance. Because balance, they invested their brains. Procter and damal does that. So all of a sudden, the brand's money from snuggle went to acts and quickly snuggles, now it'll be dark. Low share, slow will be category. And then when you look at that, Unilever says, hey, we're not in the business of playing number three, number four brands. We only play with the big ones. So therefore, they sold it off. Inwox. So that one's gone. Inwox, son products. The company that I used to work for. And the investors like, do you remember these brands? How popular they were 20 years ago? You know what? I wonder if we started investing in these again if we could get a bigger return. All of a sudden, they started shelling in money into innovation. Showing this money to advertising. Guess what's starting to happen? They're growth money. In fact, they actually started growing the category. So just three years after being sold off as a dog, guess what was the star again? It's pretty interesting. So watch out for self-fulfilling prophecy. Another example. Good friend of mine, when I was in Conegra, I was running the chef-word he-business. My cube buddy right next to me was guy named Ryan, just a first-year assistant brand manager at an Northwestern. Really smart guy. And the guy was an entrepreneur. He was working in big business, but he was an entrepreneur by heart. Anyway, so he got the very sexy role of playing with dice tomatoes and chillies. I know you're all right. Dream role, right? Dream brand. Just like yours. How many of you actually like with this role? Which is great for us. What do you use your cell with? Taco's good, what else? Bacon. Taco's good, what else?  You throw in some velvet? Melts and velvet? Distort hand to that? Got it? Done. And sales go through that. You go through the roof here. Sports season. So this is the best popular. So what do we Ryan is in our team? We're in a meeting and we get our budgets from the upcoming year. I look at my chef-wordy budget, I look at A and B, advertising for $13 million. I'm like, sweet. I look over, Ryan, what'd you give? I got $500,000. And I'm like, oh, that poor guy. But he was so excited. And I quickly learned he did not have a self-fulfillant prophecy mindset. He was in the world of being a cash cow. Okay, slow movie category. But he had pretty good share. But he didn't care that he only got $500,000. He was like, I got $500,000. I got half a million dollars to advertise my product. He was an entrepreneur. How much does half a million dollars should we not do? That is a lot of blood. And he's like, this is awesome. First call. So he wasn't down. He wasn't self-fulfill. Oh, it was me. He wasn't that. He wouldn't be called our competitor. Correct. Can I get a hold of the Belbeda brand manager? They got to hold them. Hey, Belbeda. This is your hotel. You need me. I need you. How is your budget looking for advertising this year? What if we work together? I think I, Belbeda, he was like, I don't have $3 million. He's like, I know your pain. I didn't get very much either. He goes, what if we pull our, I think I'll make you deal. If I take care of all the Belbeda cost from ads, if I can make inroads with a company to distribute the ads, would you be willing to spend the media and buy commercial space to make sure that we look awesome? So that's what he did. So he went and called his buddy that was with him and Northwestern, who had just opened up a brand new television station called Big Ten Network. Never been open for a second. First of all, he's in the, and they didn't have any sponsors. And he said, hey, we would love to do business with you. One of the most important things we went about our consumers is that they love cases of hotel gating. Would you ever let us be your kind of beginning of the, you know, you know, game day on Yes, Ben, Ben. For your game day on the Big Ten, can we be any recruits, can we be the sponsor of that? How much money do you have? I have $3 million. So, he increased his brand by 30% in one year. That's huge if you're a cash cow. Okay, beware of self-fulfilling prophecies. Don't just say, oh, I'm a dog and think like, oh, I'm a dog. Think like a nuts for a new work. You watch version here. I love that mindset. Think like that. Don't just say, oh, whoa, isn't me. And go and play. Be smart, be creative and go and have some fun.  Now, next model I want to make sure you understand. Swat. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on here. You all know Swat, correct? I'm going to give you, never play the Swat by showbiz. Okay, we do have some. So, we're going to introduce it very quickly. Swat is an acronym. Swat is an acronym. What is the S stands for? Strings. What is the W stands for? We use this. What is the O? What is the T? Right, right. Good. Now, here's an interesting fact. Most people in industry and most students don't know how to put together a proper Swat. And that's why often we'll take a Swat and we'll put it in the appendix and never look at it again. We've got to ask if you know how to use it. This can be a very powerful way. You have to understand how to categorize things. So, those of you that aren't aware of this, please know this. When you do your four C's and you're collecting facts about C company, you can organize those facts in a more meaningful way that helps you play a more effective game. Swat is the way. And you're going to take all of the key internal findings that you have. C company, internal, and if they're good for you strength, if they're bad for you weakness, or really simple. Then you're going to look at your other C's, consumers, or customers, channel, competition. If you see things that are going well for you and your company, those are called opportunities. If you see that they're out external things that are a risk to your brand, those are threats. Strengths and weaknesses are always, always, always, always internal. Opportunities and threats are always, always, always external. Can you have an internal opportunity, your organization? Yes, that's how we play in Swat. Probably weakness, you can improve them. So make sure you categorize them properly. From there, you say, okay, I'm going to sit back and look at this list of facts that I created. Which ones can I actually leverage? Which of these strengths are actually good for me? I can take you to the capitalizer. Then I'm going to look at the weakness and say, which ones do I need to reinforce? I'll tell you, Captain Moroni, the Book of Mormon, King of Swat. He's always looking for strengths and opportunities, reinforcing what he needs to reinforce and strengthen what he needs to strengthen. Really. Okay? Now opportunities, what can I potentially invest in? You can have a huge laundry list, but prioritize them. What can I potentially invest in, and then the threats you've got to identify them? Now, at that point, now you can actually start using this strategically. You've categorized them and played a better game. Now you can say, okay, how can I take my strengths and leverage them against these growth opportunities? And can you create ideas now? And goal statements here. Can this, how this interactive this can be? Can this be this a embrace or am I going to be this? How can I take my strengths and offset the threats that are out there? Leverage them putting together. So don't just take it and reinforce it when you go from there. Now, as we go forward, we're going to go out and we're going to go a bunch of market research. And when we do market research, we're going to be looking a lot at different things, trying to help us make better decisions. One of these we're going to learn is causation versus correlation. What's the difference between the two? What's causation versus correlation? What is your reaction to that? Good. So if I go over here, if I push this button, what's going to happen? Okay, you're ready? Here we go. Oh, look at that. Okay, good. Let's try again. Oh, okay, great issue. Ready yet? Hey, causation correlation. Interesting thing. When I did that, angel and over and started whispering to lately. Okay, you can smile with me. Okay? Do you think that by pushing that button, I can do that again. Let's try again. There you go. Collision correlation. Just because two things happen the same time. One causes the other. So causation does not imply causality. Or correlation does not imply causality. Just because you see two things happen the same time doesn't assume that one causes the other. Which is now what we want to remember what we're talking about earlier. Let's say your sales go down. We want you to spread it. Okay? We talked about this little bit causation correlation. We don't know. Is that fair? What would it take for us to be able to figure it out? Marking these things. Research. We have to go and start probing a little bit. So the brand manager went out and did a little bit of market research. Didn't know who we're seeing. And when she did those works, she found out some really interesting things. She found out that when she launched that product out weak, that the same next two weeks, seven up went on sale. Guess you found out that there was a new product launch coming out. Seven up. So what did they do in response? Let's make sure that people aren't saying this. Causing the correlation. They also found out that the timing was not good. G2 launched the exact same week. Could G2 feel the same job to be done as sprite? Hydration. Could it potentially share similar consumers? Yes. Causing the correlation. Oh and by the way, because G2 came out, you know that annual sale that Sprite always usually got over Walmart when they did an extra N-Campile? Well, because of that Walmart decided to give it to G2 because that was a lot more interesting and thought might drive more sales then. So not for Sprite. So now I'll send the bases to see what you've always had with it. What's going? Does this your correlation? Do you see the risk of just going and saying, hey, we're going to stop right now? Before we start taking a wait a second, what do we know for sure and what you do not know for sure? Barter research enables us to be able to make better decisions.  Okay, now I don't know to this day if that was a good move. But I will tell you a year later they redesigned the packaging again to this. So that implies to me that there might be some brand conclusion. People may have looked at that and said, I wonder if that's diet. And so they went to this. So I think there might be truth on both sides. The key in order to be able to make a solid decision is going in diving to market research. Now I apologize because of this great discussion. I need to get a chance to talk about a reading. Reading was great, wasn't it? Really cool. So we'll talk about that next time when we start class. Great discussions, we'll see you next time. Applause"
