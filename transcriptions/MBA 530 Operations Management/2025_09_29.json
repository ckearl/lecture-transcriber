  "text": "Sorry, it says Daniel sees no order of C-Standford. Well that's... That's for sure. That's for sure. Woo! That's for sure. That's for sure. It's just, that's nothing. It's just that it can make me sound like... General story. Yeah. I'm sure with like three minutes of Google you can tell me I've figured out. Don't do that. Let's see. so we're going to do something different today. And I want to just like tee up what we're going to do. This is actually what we would have done three sessions for now. But I'm going to just do it today. And it's ordering that like this is a doesn't require any prep. It does require you to have some engagement. There's no occasions. Cool. We decided to leave JD a little smattering of products. So, but it's going to chance for us today to get our heads around something that is really important for you. Head around. And maybe chance for me to do some painting and chance for us to be... I'll just like a little bit philosophical here in America about this. Cool? Okay. So, if you were really grumpy about this class, no, nobody is. Probably something the other section we've been talking about. We could, you could characterize this class as being like basically a series of complicated cases at the center of which are like some more set of processes. That's supposed to be like a little bit of a laugh. What was the case with the, what, depending on if you never had four steps? What was the case with the circuit board that we did earlier? Donner. Good, it was the circuit board. And where was our three set processes? Is it right here? Who were you talking to remember? I was on my phone last time. Yeah. I was on my phone. Okay. Do that. John, that's not true. I want to believe that that's not true. You're too good for it. You owe yourself more. Okay, five. Oh, you're saying that. You're saying that. Actually, actually. I'm trying to support it somewhere. Zach was, uh, ElectroPlay. Yeah. Zach, uh, and then, and then what, who were our machine tools up here in the case with, uh, Arthlam Rayon? Sharme, what, what step were you? Very strong. You were going to go to the same place. You were a step board? Yeah, you were a step board. Yeah. Okay. So, uh, okay. I want to just highlight something about this. Zach, what was you saying to Ranzan? Remember? I don't know what I was saying. What was it? Remember? No, I was like, what? What do you have to say? 25. What do you have to say? 25. What? And 8.5. What's 5? What's 5 or 10? 5. Where's 1 to 5 seconds? 2.2. 10. 22. What's it? 45 and 1.5. Okay. And, uh, Sharme, do you remember the internal damage from my support? No, I don't. I'm just concerned. Okay. I want to just sort of collect something interesting here. Um, that's actually not like reality. In reality, probably sometimes it's going to take like 25 minutes of setup. And other days, you know, you take a couple of red bulls and your setup time is going to be, or, or, or you do something really simple. And we've done in the previous uh, cycle. And your setup time is going to be like 15 minutes. The next day, you know, you get bad news. You're filling like, you know, tired. And the setup can be like 40 minutes, right? Like that, that is, that's actually the reality that we live in. If there's uh, there's like, the area of the building. In fact, if you want to get like, big uh, philosophical like doctoral scriptural about this. Like, the easy life where everything works. And we knew the outcome. What is that like? What is that like? Like say, you're semester. Wait, what is our idea of it? Is it the first semester? No, no. Say it in time. Sorry. Yeah. Last summer, was the Garden of Eden. I think it was happy at night. And then you're thrown into like this place where nothing makes sense. You always be like, you know, like all this stuff. This is, we're going to say that this world where these numbers are fixed is uh, it's almost like, this is almost like uh, my operation is a philosophy class. Unlistened. We read like Calvin on like predestination. And that would be, that would be uh, like a deterministic world. Where, where the outcome is already determined from the start. Where I know it's going to happen in hell, you just gotta go figure it out. Like that's uh, everything is, it's 25 minutes every single time, 8.5 minutes. In reality, this is not true. What are some things that you like could imagine would slow down or speed up? Like in the real world for us. Somebody says, do you guys have anybody sort of party to this section? I don't know, I wouldn't think so. I don't see anybody sort of party here, but yeah. People show up, so like, yeah, what else? People in general. People in general. Like, when you say good, let anything about it first is going to be very cool. It's kind of moods, circumstances, timelines. Life events. Happy. What are you creating? Carden, wait, where's her name, Jerry? Not here. Monkey, here's our name. He's here quietly judging and laughing and laughing. This is all in there. Why are you? People in general. I just need an elevator. No, he didn't. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. Raise your hand to the woman. You guys, okay. In the creative world. There's no answer to that. There's no answer to that. Like, what's the craziest thing you've seen with productivity with a creative? Either bad or good. I don't know. Forgetting a name tag. What do you care? In terms of what, what do you mean? Like, yeah, like, I mean, like, what's the like, half-foot rate of stuff that you were involved with? So I work with artists. So, you know, disabled people. Yeah. What's the output? Very, very, well, all over the place. Like, why? Because they're people. Like I said, back to them. I work with an artist that he would weeks and weeks of, oh, next week. And it was just like, get your stuff. You're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to deliver something to me weekly. And he would. What do you think was going on in the background? Oh, I knew him very well. And he was doing whatever he wanted to do. This is all an artist's act. Like, general contractors would never do this to you. What's that? Never. Is he ever like, been involved in building a house or doing a project that went over? What happened, buddy? There's always the, oh, well, I haven't gotten this back from this guy. And like, oh, well, he's busy with some of these things. He has a called back-ass, my brother works in construction management. And he handled the renovation for my parents out. And it's always, oh, well, that guy still has to do this other thing before he can do this. And then, okay, for that. What? Like what? Take me for a little, okay, don't. I have a little finish. Anybody, don't buy a jackpot or an over. And Garvin. Anybody heard of the man? I guess I'll cancel the order. Yes. For what is he? I'm worried. You know what's happening with Jack, where I'm earlier, and you called this? Do you know? They basically, what happened? What did he do? Well, I mean, they're who we burn it. Yeah, there's, you know what? That's not a lot of the rebrand that was like disastrous, we think. They have like a computer virus that infected their ERP system? They have a producer card in like a month or two. And literally somebody in Russia is holding the company hostage. I think. They, like, they literally can't produce cards. Like, they're having to just go back in and make it like you're out of here. It's, it's what. Okay, so that's like a second thing. My, my, this is an experience, it's like Siri, my brain, in my own experience. When I was, so I graduated from the program here and got hired by Ford Motor Company. And then like a finance rotation, like finance leadership rotation program. Like awesome, whatever, and every time. And working with operations. Particularly. Second, I hired, go, and part of this rotation program that they put you in a factory for like six months managing like actual like line workers. So I go, I get, I'll tell you the story sometimes, it was lots of fun. There's like, I'm going to respond to like 40 people on the hands of nine at the Michigan truck making expeditions in America. It's really fun. It was like a, a jacket was like embroidered like stuff. And like, I have a look at Wachitake and it was really cool. So I'm on the line and there's a, there's a person on the lines guy halfway through his job was to install three plugs in the bottom of the engine block. And come across in this conveyor of like a boat and that level. And he started making mistakes like bad mistakes. Like basically like every other one had a leak or like a problem with it. The next person in the line would observe this and say like, dude, you gotta fix this. And it was probably so eventually that next person in the line gave me like, dude, like he is the only mess in everything. One, cool, like well, I cooked a deal with this because I don't know if I mentioned I was your operations last. And he's like, just on the down low. So you know, that dude is like most days in his like little locker that he has right next to his place in the line. He has a full bottle of whiskey and he's drinking like half the bottle. And what you don't know is that like a week ago he decided to go cold turkey and go off alcohol. So he's actually like, doing pretty well when he's drinking. And when he's not drinking, he's like messing stuff up. So like, I didn't expect that my little world had contemplated this kind of state of affairs. Like that this little guy. Okay, so we live in a following world. As we know from events recently. And part of our job here in this class is to try to develop intuition about how operating processes work. Cool? Like, again, I said this in slides on day three. My job is not necessarily to convince you to be in operations people. But every good manager should have some good intuition about how operations and processes work. And that's our goal is to kind of do the word intuition. Here's the problem. The problem is, in my experience, when you introduce variability into a process, our intuition breaks down a bit. And if you want to get fancy and sound like you're cool, we can even say we can characterize a process like this. Let's say it's 25 minutes of setup plus or minus, let's say, 10 minutes. So someplace in that range from 15 to 35 minutes, maybe you have a normal distribution you're pulling from, maybe some cool Gaussian distribution or a uniform, like whatever, it's going to be like different each time. And that's actually like reality. And we could call a process that has variability in it. We go to fancy, we could call it a stochastic process. The Gaussian is just fancy. We have say variable, pull from some light distribution. Cool? Okay. Now, our intuition that says it's going to break down a little bit here. And what we're going to do today is try to model this out to genome brain tissue. So, we're going to use a dye today for fun and help us like model the variability in the variable. Cool? So, by the way, Jen, no quiz on a chart of verdict today. There will be that. You're a prep artist. You're a prep artist. You're a prep artist. You're a prep artist. You're a prep artist. Well, they're going to get him right. I don't know. Because what? It's a variable world. We don't know. Some days you prep for the right questions. Some days you prep for the wrong questions. Just like a big step. This is what we're going to do. Okay. How is the, how does the real world outside of the world? Okay. So, here's what I'd like to do. Let's say, I'm not going to use the dye yet. Let's start with just like a simple one step process. And today instead of using psychotimes, we're going to use output rates. And here's the way I'm going to drop this. We're going to say that this one step process can make 3.5 Lego cars per hour. So, you know, the first day of class when you did those Lego cars, you probably would have a little bit faster than this. But if I just said Jake, here's a big bit of Legos. Nice. Yeah, you don't get to play. We're going to watch Jorge and how fast he does these things. And what we're going to say here, this one step process is, if Jorge starts making these things just by himself, he can make 3.5 cars per hour. Cool. If you're doing steps one through 26, so where do those, those kinds of things go? Are we going with this? Okay. But what's a cold call? Likely. Likely, sorry. Likely. You look like you wanted to. Absolutely. Likely. This is a good one. How many cars will Jorge produce at the end of the book? Will he have produced at the end of the first hour? 3.5? Sure. Yeah. Okay. Well, culture minus. No, this is where I determine a sequel. So this is 3.5 cars per hour after one hour. Cool? Okay. Likely, here's what I want to do. We're going to split the duties between, actually, what I can do for any John, we're going to do Alex and Cory. And the thing you don't know about these guys is that they're actually going to explode. Oh, I don't know. About like half as fast as Jorge. Cool? Yes. Oh, no, they're slow because we put big winter gloves on both of them, and they have to do later with them. What? Okay. Likely, so here's the way we'll model this. Alex does the first 13 steps, and then Cory does steps 14 to 26 on the latest. Cool? And we're going to start them with, like, we'll just be up and running, and then you walk up, and then push to stopwatch, and then an hour later, push again, and how many they produced. And what we're going to say, because I'm a little bit forceful here, saying that it's both of them have an output rate that's the same as before. But what's it going to make so that it's easy to work through? Likely, what's your prediction of how many cars they will and produce after an hour? They both have an output rate of 3.5. With the winter gloves, then a half? Yeah, well, what I'm saying is they have to do half the number of steps. So they're always, yeah, forget the one I'm glovesing, and that's good news. How many of you think they're going to make after an hour? They have the same operating and inputting action to be the same. Yeah. 3.5. Okay. Awesome. Cars produced. Produced. One hour. Okay, plainly, this is high level difficulty here. What if we have the same set of pairs, same set of pairs? We got 3.5, 3.5. How many will we produce after an hour? Three now. Okay. Any questions right now about this? Lindsay just casts a quizzical look toward the board. What was a quizzical look for? Just absorbing, to be honest. Okay. But the reason we're not going to start from over the day is Lindsay bucked all the sharp numbers on the screen. And I can, I can, I can, you can, you can, I'll take it from my. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. I'm on this. I think. I have a start. Okay, good, good. So another like real war consideration that we've like waved our hands at here is like material handling time or like train time conversations. We never said in Carlos, were you up here for a, for the never-decker? Yeah. So we never said like how many point three minutes it took to pass from Carlos to Charmagne. We just kind of include that in the, probably in the external time. If we were being really serious about it, we probably, we probably, we'd be better at the end. Yeah. Something? No, I'll just run. Okay. Don't go to an auction today. You're like a spotter. Why did you got it? I guess Brad. If we're four people and they're like 3.5 will be done right, but aren't they're going to be like four cars in progress at eight times? So are we going to have like if we're counting half the car, I can have another, it's like 0.25 done and another. Brad says one thing that will change, we haven't, we haven't allowed likely for the output rate to change, but with the added stations, Brad says that we've added working process inventory. What else would we expect to go up if we keep out of it? We're going to say, but we increase working process in Brazil. We've got time. Through the times we're going to take longer to get that, that's something through that. Okay. Are we cool so far? Joe. I have a case number 4 for you saying that. Each member now taking that. Yeah, so that's why I artificially slowed it down. I almost forgot to write that. We've slowed it down. We've got to figure out like, what it was for the first time. Just to make the numbers work. Just to clarify why watching this connection line at 2pm. Not at our zero because we're going to have something to say. Yes. But we're going to stack it from the zero. Yes, we're going to have to look at it. Yes, so we're going to call this in steady state operation. Meaning we're not looking at the startup. I mean, won't you in the Shakespearean literature, what happens when you start in the middle of the same, when they call this? Who said that? NBS, right? Yes, okay. So NBS, right? You just start as we keep on moving. You know, we're like, junk is an old assume, and there are these right here. That's what happens. That's what happens. Okay. Operations, humanity's class. It's not listed. It's not listed. It's because it's so heavily subscribed. You don't want to play that. Okay. Cool. Now, lately I like the way she's characterized this. Like, there's one more question for you. Let's say we introduce the real world here. And on average, we have a worker, turning out to 3.5 cars per hour. And in order to model the variability that comes to the real world, we're going to just use a simple device of this dye. And what are the values on a dye here? One through six. Okay. So, one, two, three, four, five, or six. And basically what we're going to use, this dye for is to model, like, how much red bull, or how many, you know, breakups or whatever, this person has, given going into this day. Okay. So, once the, if we roll this all, a whole bunch of times, and trip those things and average them out, like, leaning against this, the world will be the average. 3.5? How'd you get that? Because, assuming it's not a weighted dye, you get each one the same number of times. Okay. We get, I love it. We got a fair dye. And we're going to actually call this average here, the expected value. This is, if we roll it enough times, and take that, that's what we expect to see. Sometimes you've got to roll one, sometimes you're roll six, but sometimes put on average, it's going to end up at 3.5. Cool? Okay. So, likely, let's build this, variable process, rather than a deterministic one. So, these are, determine, and, and this, and these are going to be variable. Let's say that this is 3.5 plus or minus 2.5. And the reason we're in the 3.5, those are went 2.5 is 3.5 minus 2.5 is 1. That's the lowest possibility. If we went 5 plus 2.5 is going to be 6. And all of these are going to be, this is a uniform distribution, where any of these values is equally likely. We, there are two things actually, usually there are some kind of, like, mass in the middle of a distribution, or on the side of the distribution, it's not uniformly, but just for fun, these right now, we're going to just have a uniform distribution. Okay. Now, I have a question, like, after, let's, let's run this process for an hour. And, and here's what we're going to do, or let's run it for like 10 hours. Let's run it for 10 hours. We're going to roll the die. Our one, we produce 4. Our two, we produce 3. Let's stop right there. Our, our three of the first, we do two, then five. Six of the four. And that's, and so. What would we expect if we brought this enough times, how many an average are we going to be producing per hour? Three now. Three now. Okay. Are we going with this? What's a goal cut? So, I don't know, you're prepared much. Somebody just, inside you're like, I don't want to raise my hand. I think I should just raise my hand now. We don't need to be prepared. You could just, like, put your hand up. I have a, I have a, I have a, Lindsay. Okay, that's good. I realize this, but sometimes, like, sometimes, so many times more and like, other glasses and less than mine or more and mine and less others. Probably it all seems like a thank you, but like, it's okay. What's that? Just like, well, it is. Lindsay. Let's model this next process. Lots or minus 2.5. Okay. We're going to put another process together with it in a dependent relationship. You have to do one after the other. Lindsay, what's your prediction, card investigation for how many of them we're going to produce after, like, 10 and 10 hours. How can you range from... It could be a range I totally agree with that. Quick. You got it. Three point five. Okay. So, Lindsay's, this is Lindsay. Lindsay's, you know, guess or prediction. Three point five. Okay. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to model this out with roofing hands. And I'm just going to do this. You guys are going to watch. Okay. Don't talk to your brother about it. Okay. So, here's our... Dalin and Cory. Here's how we're going to do this. What do we call this play? This... What? Yeah. Wrong materials inventory. And it's going to be right there. Dalin and Cory are going to be a two-step process and Alex is going to count. And here's how this works. Dalin and Rolodyne met the Germans how many of these roofing nails he produces in the first sight. So, go ahead. Okay. So, he's going to produce four and then pass the long year to Cory. Four. Okay. Cory is not going to roll. Okay. Now, if Cory rolls three, he's going to take two inches or three. He's going to take those three and pass them to the finished goods inventory pile. Kurt Chunk. Three Kurt Chunk. Kurt Chunk, Kurt Chunk, Kurt Chunk. Right, Jeremy? Right. Do you remember how we spelled Kurt Chunk? No. Do you remember how we spelled Kurt Chunk? Yes. 38 or 18. You're going to be 18. You're going to be 18. That was the quiz, Tien. That was the quiz, Tien. But do we all get 100? No. So, we're going to see why. I don't know. Okay. So, this thing produced two. Now, we're going to have two possible things in areas here that are a couple of things that happen. Let's say, there's a whole bunch of stuff I'm not sure about my childhood in my home. Let's say that we're not doing this now here. These are egg salad sandwiches. And I have a deep paranoia of old egg salad sandwiches. Probably goes back to elementary school lunches. Oh. Ooh. And the deal is we throw away old egg salad sandwiches. Like, over-production of egg salad sandwiches. Or they have to wait for a long time here. They get soggy and they get botched with them. So, you don't have to throw it. And you have to throw it. Okay. So, that's the situation. If you have to overproduce this, and there's more here than is needed, we're just going to take that out. We're going to have to overproduce this. Tomorrow, for tomorrow's cold lunch. Because that's not good. Okay. Now, well again. Okay. He's going to produce three. Cory, go ahead. Okay. Cope. He's in front of that. That's great. Cory just rolled up four. Okay. So go ahead, he's four, Cory. Oh. But he only has three. So he doesn't have enough. He's just going to pass along whatever he can. Are we full support? Okay. So those are the rules. And at the end, we're going to do 10 cycles of this at the end of this. Alex is going to count this up. And we're going to look for it when we get. Okay. So you guys, because you're right just sitting in the front row, not like those people sitting in the back. Oh. I know. That's deterministic. Say it's blood. Yes. Okay. Each training group is a semi-ferrepresented, get a pile of grouping nails like this. And five guys. Like that. And, uh, let me do it. Go side and call you, say it. Nice per person or five guys. We need one per person. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have a few people. Yeah. We're going to have to do that. That's it. That's it. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know that. Yeah, yeah. All right. We're fine. I wanna eat this. Yeah. Go ahead and tell us whang. Yeah. You're getting fired. Yeah. All right. I'm going to have to go. What's the score? 50, although this is trying to hard, they got 3.5. 4.5. That was the only thing I've ever seen. You would have felt that way. You would have. You would have. I would have seen. I would have seen. You would have seen. Lansing, but not the one in the present. Your prediction was 3.5. You've ended up lower than that. Yeah, also. What happened? I'm going to pass. You're going to pass or I guess. No. Slow. Slower. Definitely slower. Okay. In fact, let's, let's, well. Here you go. What happened? The average in that case is not 3. Because you have a C's option. Well, 3.5 is the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. How again? Okay. Right, what happened? We basically only took the lowest of 2 numbers. So we had to run twice because we didn't let our upward, like our upward variability. If we had a 6 and a 1, it was 1. Okay. So let's, let's just, we're going to write this out like really simply. Let's say we did it step and die. Right. You're going to have to have a count of this. Instead of die, why don't we get a coin flip? And we had two possible outcomes, either slow or fast. Cool? Why did we did this? Brett, what are the possibilities? Because we can have slow, slow, slow fast. Just, hang on, this is really good. So station 1 and station 2, Brett says there are a couple of possibilities here, back there, just four possibilities. If both of them roll slow, or flip a die and do slow, in this case, I'm going to give you one or something like that. What is the overall speed of the line? Slow. Slow, I'm curious. Okay. Brett, what's another possibility? Slow fast. Okay. So we could do, Dalin goes slow and Corin goes fast. Brett, the resulting performance of the overline is what? Slow. You basically are going to take a minimum of these two possibilities. Here, what's the slow slow? Fast, slow. Fast, slow. Slow, slow, slow, and then fast fast. And once the overall line is speeded, we both go fast. And not claiming to question anybody's integrity here, but somehow that team, the team, ended up being able to like, it could happen that, you know, Quentin L. you rolled fast. I want to question. What's that? I feel a question. No, we are not on Tinder, all right? We were working. We have a account. It might, the way we said it. We had Theron Lee. I'm not mad at you. I just know more about you now. I'm not getting to know you. You know more about him. In fact, it's an FB like the first year of our career, and then it's kind of stuck. Okay. It could be the case. Work in Doc Lent. Not really. Actually, of course, I mean, everything. We could in an episode of situations where in these two groups, you do actually have a 3.5 and a 4-point. Like, you could get lucky and just get fast so much times. Like, that happened. You do groups. But in general, our performance is going to go down. In fact, well, let's talk about these two situations here that you observe. So what caused us to slow down slower than 3.5? Jacob? So just like I said, we're relating second. Have you played Dungeons and Dragons? When I was in fifth grade, I went through a phase of like two months where I did that. I used to know what rolling with this advantage. No. It's where you roll twice or multiple times, and you take the lowest value. Okay. So basically, rolling with this advantage right here. Nice. Okay. For those of us who don't remember fifth grade as well, or that are like, you know, not in the exact same right-of-year. Like, you're trying to think that a little bit for us. So basically, you have multiple attempts to do something, which everyone is at worst. Attempts. That's what you're stuck with. Yeah. Okay. Ian? Sorry. What do you have to hand up to? I was going to say something similar, but you guys got anybody told to your... Did you get any? I guess you're just... Because of the whole rolling distance, there's greater opportunities to be involved. So the more stations, the more numbers and the roll we have, the higher likelihood that there's going to be a little bit. Okay. When you're watching people... I love this. When you're watching people roll. What... How would you... Like... We're going to put it on our humanities hat or something here for a second. And like, how would you... How would you characterize the situation where number... Station number one can go faster than station number two. Sorry. What would you call that? Like, what do you feel like when you're station number one, you're going faster than station number two. I wasted my roll. You wasted your roll? Who I like? That keep going? Like, what would you call that condition? During the team, that's good, but you're not. It's like... The rest of the impact actually can go fast. Sorry. In balance. In balance and love this. So, according to some really interesting... Precision duration. That's like... That's agnostic as to whether a first or second station is slow and faster. But saying that they have different values. Sure. I just felt under utilized. Under utilized? You know, the Tinder more or yet is good. You may have processed fundamentals. Remember what they call this? What is the situation when you can go faster than your next person? What do you feel like you are? We're going to call this a... Blockage. What? Condition. The blockage condition is when station 1 can go faster than station 2. They're blocked. They can't push through any more product. They're not going to the garbage or to some other place. Now, in our situation here, we... I jokingly talked about the Romance Challenge. I'm going to use that to tell you this real. There could be situations where you can store stuff over to the next track. We're going to talk about a case later in the semester about a cancer medication made by Genentech. One of the little insights we're going to have during the case stomachaches is if you overperish, you can actually freeze this protein until the next year. It tells the man arises and you can use it. It has a pretty big shelf life. You can see why they might want to do that. Because it's expensive to not have enough cancer medication. We talked about forraries at some point that have two little okay because it doesn't have Alex. I understand that. You are a real example of where you would have to discard. I guess I'm just starting to see why. Do we have a case where it's expensive to have... Where stuff in the process goes obsolete if it's sitting there in a new drawer. I'm going to put it down. I'm going to show you what I'm going to do. Yeah. Sit. The first is buying that dude back to the steam room in the door. It's right there. If you have like, or iPhones, if you produce a whole bunch that don't get demanded in the next round, and you're stuck holding a bunch of iPhone 16 inventory and it comes out, then that goes back. Here's an extreme version actually. The extreme version is made this year a little bit closer to your world. What do you do if... What do you do if you have people that you're employing, a mortgage broker like twice, and interest rates were really high, and the people that are processing mortgages sit around playing Tinder a lot, right? So you've got a situation where you've got extra capacity to get that done using. And then interest rates go down and there's a lot of demand. Can you just take some of that processing capacity and move it into this year? No. So one of the interesting insights about service operations, that's a little bit different from manufacturing operations is you can't carry over... You can't move capacity around from 9.1 to 10. What happens if you're running a hotel, you've got a married hotel, and you've got like half your room filled now, and next week as a big convention, then you're like, all of you are filling up next week. Can you just take some of that capacity and move it into the next week and move it into the next week? Yeah, exactly. When the convention's over or whatever. So, carrying over inventory is easier in some kinds of industries and some industries as far. This is why Dan doesn't eat sushi unless I can smell the ocean. Because I don't trust anybody to have raw tuna. Probably that's what people are pulling out. You don't play with trees? No, my mom's in Sharpie. No, none of my siblings and I do love yoga if we just throw some action. Because I'm advocating that in my house. There's a deal. You're kids overspod to whatever happens. Is this food boys about a couple times? Or are you telling them I'm fine with that? There's a middle ground. There's probably a middle ground. Okay, so, I always have a big one. Okay, so we have condition one is station one should go fast from station two. We're going to pull out a blockage. What's the kind of conversation that station two could go faster, but station one isn't providing them enough stuff. What would you go on that condition? It is a bottleneck. A lot of idle time. Yes, Sharpie. Shrinkage? Shrinkage. Shrinkage. I totally agree with that. In fact, we're going to use a specific term that relates to Shrinkage here. Any insects come out? We're going to call this a nod blockage condition. We're going to call this starvation. Are you cool with that? We're going to call this a starvation stroke. So station one could go back to if there's star for sup to work on. This is, you know, carbon sitting around waiting to process the output from the artist, but the day artist won't produce it. He's a starvation condition for sup to work on. Cool? Okay. Can we reset that to super clearly? Is it the first one? These are basically just a flips of one versus the other. So condition one is one is faster than two. James, you're cool with that. And the starvation is two is faster than one. Cool? So are we staying in reality when it goes back and forth between that? It's based on human elements? Maybe. There are also machines like to have some variability in them. But I want to just go back quickly to Lindsey's horrible mistake. Is that too cold? No. Lindsey, why was your intuition that... So remember back to what Blakely said here. Blakely said, you know, one station condition, 3.5 plus or minus 2.5, it's going to like work out. Some days you have good days, some days you have bad days. Right? Lindsey said, but she's kind of pretty the same thing. Some days, this, this back for years is going to have some good days, some days it's going to have bad days, but in like the carbon balance in the universe, it's going to even out. And you'll have like 2.5 on the other side. Some days it's going to be bad. Why does that not happen for everybody here? Again, just the limitations of the way we wrote the die. Okay, good guy. Keep going page. I think because if station one has a bad day, one day, station two has a good day. It's going to flip the next day and then we have two bad days. It doesn't matter. Okay, awesome. Does this make sense? So this is why it's not like a fantastic, okay? We'll stop there. Page since you brought it up. What do you think is going to happen when we do four stations? I think it's just going to continue to keep going. Okay, let's do that really quick. Four stations. Let's get some actual empirical data. I think I'm sure it'll work. Yeah. Yeah. Greg, you want to monitor it? Okay, four. Four. Four. We need four. And you go first. Okay, so start there. I think I see that. I think I see that. Five. Five. Five. Six. Five. Four. Four. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Six. Six. You got one again? Sign the order! Nine. We don't have one. We don't have one. We don't have one. We don't have one. We got one. We got one. We're counting. Six, six, seven. We're counting. We're counting. trade now is fine for a coal h You let go. You let go. I'm starting to start like that. I'm going to be right. Walk it. That's it. That's it. You have two. Four. One point three. One point three. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! I said, come here. Come here. Wow, we just got one right over here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. There we go. You guys take four points. I'll be off the hook. Some of us are drinking. I'll be off the hook. I'll be off the hook. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. I'm going to have to go. Yeah. Yeah. Does the Hand cactus work? Does the Handproduction work? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions? Yeah, the Towel. This is the game. But you've got to play. I don't think that's true. This is why I think it's true. Christopher Volkett's. Sorry. It's like old father and a nice teacher. I'm just so happy to see him. I'm just so happy to see him. You get that one. I'm just going to show him up. Chance or nothing. Okay. Let's graph this out. Let's see if we can make any sense. So why don't we take a number of stations. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. We've got, and then this is a second timer, or if not, average produced per hour, three, four, one, two, three, four. We said that with one station, we produced 3.5 per hour, with two stations, it was 2.87. Oh, sorry. That's where that was. Two stations with 2.87. And three, sorry, four stations is 1.72. Okay. Okay. Observation number 1, what happens to our output as we add dependent stations that are variable to 1. I see Zachary can the international symbol for a negative slope. Down? It will forever increase the asymptote limit to 1. Oh, okay. Have to stay for 1. Enter. Enter. Enter. Enter. We go watch smart people here. That's what we're all about right here. Okay. The station is over 1. Or a cyclotron. That's right chart. That's not for here. Oh, okay. By the way, cyclotron is 18. You ready to run the game run? No. Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Who came up with it? Dance. Dance. Dance. Dance. Any evidence? Just somebody really quickly Google any evidence. Yeah, do you have any evidence? They should have resigned as a trace for something. No. Who like evidence? Follow. She says she's an American scholar. She's a professor of leadership at Harvard Business. Okay. HBS. What department is she in? Ops. She's in technology enforcement. She's in technology enforcement. She's in technology enforcement. Oh, there it is. Yes. She's in technology enforcement. She's in technology enforcement. It makes it the one that comes up. So, I want to say the game from... Actually, the spot is like... Yeah, it's just a simple bit of one. And our husband's a... A.M. Department of Medical School. Geez. Wow. I was just trying to buy a house. So, that was really Q-ling now. Before we get into it, Dave dropped a thing about it in the end. We said that it slopes down. Why does... Why does output decrease as we add stations together? It's complicated. Is it, Jared? Because you're increasing the variability. So, I like one average and more like that it's someone with a little one. All you need is like one person having a bad day. Alex, is your earlier question? This is never happened. This is probably the other question. Like, there's... Right, Christie? Yeah. What happens when you take your marketing presentation in the by-and-four? And there's one person who has a really bad week. Yeah, that's what I do. So, the more people you put on a project, the more you increase the likelihood that at least one of those people is going to have a bad day. And if only one of the bad days the debt doesn't get submitted. Or doesn't get paid. Right? This is the world's definition of the phrase you're only a strong user. Exactly. And this is also why the dysfunctional people would say, again, you need something done just do it yourself. The problem with that if you do it yourself and take out all of the... Like, you miss out on some potential, like, upside and creativity and all that stuff. So, this is what happens. Dalin was ridiculed earlier. Like, it's small-minded classmates. Observes that not only does this slow go downward, but it has a second order condition that goes up and sort of goes down, but it papers off. And Dalin says, this is going to be expected as the taper off to what Dalin just above. It's going to approach but never hit. And the reason is what? Because no matter how many times you do it a million times, there's at least going to be one time where the weakest link is still a two. There's a possibility that somebody's up there. And we're never going to go below one because our values have to be values of the number of people. Okay, cool. So, how do we fix this? We just said we put processes together and that makes them worse. That was not our intuition. Lindsay, I've been using you as a foil here. And I'm with the foil. It's like a just additional plate. We're using Lindsay's coming as a foil here. Why did we, I thought the same way actually. Why, why, why, why did we believe before that it was going to like all work out? I mean, probability mostly. Yeah, okay, cool. And then we found out when we changed together processes that are dependent on one of the variables, it doesn't work. And the reason is block observation and like, you know, like we're going to have some bottleneck that slows down everybody. That was our, we have to tune up our intuition because that wasn't my intuition going into this class when I put it in person. Okay. How do you fix the condition here? And I'm going to go, I'm, I'm, Corey, how do you fix the condition? I'm just going to say do it where it did and make it so the baseline is really easy. To Shiba? I'll show you. To Shiba? I can't remember the name of it, but it made the process so simple. So that even if someone's having a bad day, they can do it. So like super lower than the bar. I like that a lot. You could probably guess that that's the pretty cool in some ways to the Shiba case, when they made such super super simple and then tried to divide it up really, make it really balanced. Any other thoughts on how you could fix this? I just don't group everyone together. How would you like not group people together? You made a different cluster like what we talked about. Okay, like a cell kind of thing. That's cool. Here you go. You use inventory. How do you use inventory? Okay, no, no, no. Watch this. Brad and Aaron. Aaron, station one. Watch this. Aaron, station one. Brad is station two. No, no, leave that there. That's a piece of technology we really need, Brad. We just gave GEO some inventory. He's actually not a productive step. All he is is a pile of stuff. Aaron rolls a six. And Brad rolls a one. What's going to happen? Where does the inventory go? It gets pile of inventory at Diego. Now what happens? Aaron, you roll one. Pretend like you're roll one. And then Brad rolls a six. Brad, what do you do? Take six. Take six out of them. What would we call that thing that Diego was sitting in front of? With, where do you use a cool or not name? Stop, stop. Who said that? Jacob said, technical term buffer. And what we're going to call this an inventory buffer. And turns out, that's an inventory buffer. And we could allow us to store those Excel sandwiches or cancer medication, or whatever, between steps. We can actually do something really cool. Diego, what were you saying? He was thinking that in a real process, you studied the variability of each station. Maybe I was thinking in the machines. And you know, if you have an old machine, as the example of it, maybe you have to think in inventory buffer in that place. Why did you say old machine? Everybody just locking for five more minutes. This is going to be a couple of like, you're equal moments that we're going to have here with Diego. Why did you say old machine? Why? Yeah, because you... What is an old machine? So, Aaron is an old machine, Brad's a new machine. What's the difference? Or like, how are they going to... You have more variability in the new machine that they are matching. Okay. So, you are... What did... What does Diego do to these two dependent processes? When we put that inventory buffer between them? What would you call this Lindsay? Independent. They can be independent? Okay, this deep cut, I don't know if everybody is going to remember this, because you all are pretty young. Chris Martin and Brent Paul show up. What did they do? How did they characterize their separation? What do you remember? Oh, gosh. Or, come on. No, I don't like to think about them. They named their kid Apple. What did they call this? What did they say they did when they split up? Nobody remembers? I remember it was mutual. Oh, what's good? Yes, there's a couple of years you're on there, or something. It's something like that, where they both agreed. Yeah, it was like a bunch of wish you watched. It was a way to get them together. So, they said they were consciously uncomfortable. Oh, yeah. I'm going to be my intern. What Diego did to those two stations there? They were consciously uncomfortable. That bumper, decouples, two competitive processes for one another, that allows them to operate independently. So, just think about Diego, that pile of nails in front of Diego right now. If he has a big enough buffer, you can nearly ensure that Aaron and Brad are never going to like block or star. In fact, he has to be something about this like applying while the road is going dice. You could imagine a situation where Aaron rolls one, a hundred times in a row, and Brad rolls six, a hundred times in a row, what's going to happen to Diego to your buffer then? One and six. Yeah. What's going to happen to your buffer? It's going to go down to zero eventually, if you have like a bunch of unlucky rolls. What would happen if Aaron rolls a six, like a million times in a row, and Brad rolls a one, a million times in a row? It's going to go big. Okay. So, a buffer decouples two steps. You could actually calculate, this is not exactly your, it's kind of relating to what you're actually. You could calculate how big that buffer should be if you had some sense in your business of how costly it would be for us to make Aaron like go idle for a while, or Brad go idle for a while. And if we want to say like those two are like PhD scientists and we never want them to be inactive, we could make a huge buffer. We would actually be willing to put that buffer there. And if we're like, their time isn't that valuable, we could make the buffer really small, but it would depend on what our characterization was of how expensive it was. What's the cost of the buffer in front of the Diego? I have to do it, but time goes out. Oh, goodness gracious. That reduces our ability to respond to the market because we have a whole bunch of those things piled up in there doing FIFO first and first out like, that ex-allot sandwich by the time, if we got a pile of 1,000 ex-allot sandwiches, and we got to wait for two months to get them through there, don't go to the machine sound service. Don't risk it. No, do not do it. Good way to go. Good luck, Pixar tonight, for sure. You can run it. That's expensive. What's the other cost for you? Some being down or tell us what's the cost of having a bunch of inventory. Financiates. What's that? Financiates, of course, to the... You got to actually own that inventory, so you're going to borrow probably, or it's on your books as an asset, and you could be investing in other stuff with those assets. Okay, so that thing is there really quickly, a buffer doesn't help us in a couple of situations. Number one, what did we say... What was the case where we have all of the socks and the sweaters? Yeah, yeah. And we kind of visually calculated how many bins were in front of Jake, and how many were in front of Jorge and John. Do you remember this? Yeah. How many bins were there? Three-ish. How many children sweaters were in a bin? Two. Two-one. If we start having problems, because we're doing the wrong color of the thread, we said it's going to take like 600 bad units before Jake notices until Zach, he's making garbage. One of the costs of having all of those two nails in a pile there is rats I can be able to tell Karen is making bad stuff until he works all the way through that pile. So that's another cost. It's not just like carrying assets on the books. It's not just reducing our response to market forces. It's also that it can hurt quality because we get slower feedback when we're causing problems. Cool? If you're like contracted on this, what we're dancing around here is at the core of the lean philosophy. The lean philosophy that we're going to talk about later with Toyota production system and other things says, basically we're forced that buffer to be really small, like maybe nothing, but a lean out so there's no buffer there. And that's going to make it so that we see problems when they appear. There's a problem that, you know, Aaron and Brad are in balance. There's a problem, you know, Aaron keeps showing up for work. Jeff got on red bulls and Brad's not enough sleep. And so that's a positive problem. That's like something from the fix. Is that okay? You wouldn't do that. He gets you a couple of red bulls. Can't handle them. I don't know. I think it seems like you're going to say something. Me? Sure. Oh, man. Hey. Well, is it just you want to make a lean? I guess my question is like, you just look at the cost. Yeah. The cost of like, the slower group of time, the cost of a leaner. That's right. Let me just, let me end by saying this. If you, so buffers help us, let's let's rewind and check where we are. I'll be telling you the next question. When we interest variability, it changes our intuition about how processes work. When we chain, lean together dependent processes, they're variable. The world gets worse. It doesn't look that somehow better. When we lose time, we always lost that time. We can't go back and like, reconstitute an excel at sandwich once we've lost it. That's why chain seats together. It makes us worse. Buffers help us by decoupling processes and allow them to operate independently. But they're not a cure offer, everything, because they come with costs. Cool. Page. Say what you said again. You actually weigh the cost of the mistakes versus the through the back. Exactly. So this is not like buffers are always good or always always bad. You're going to have to weigh the costs. The sort of, the philosophy of lane says, one way to attack problems in a process is to go and force yourself to lean them out and that reveals what the problems are. And it reveals you, it requires you to lower these costs that Page is talking about. So next time, we're going to, there will be a little bit very good. We'll go back a little bit, because it's going to be a little, crank away a charcoal burner. We're going to have to think really hard. And crank away on a natural cranking. And we're going to definitely hard. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you."
