  "text": "I'm sorry. Thank you. Our hearing was ours. We were able to stay in with people for a while. There's how many IELTS in the school and around the AIS and I'm worried if you could just go in and do better than one another. I ask that you all spoke to us to see what we take. We were able to do five or two hours of hearing from the school. We were able to start off with a great ceremony here. How was the last session? Great. I'm going to tell her about my father. That's what it was, right? No. It was a hard-to-help father's foot. Okay. What are we going to have today? Grand Bury. Grand Bury. That's what I prepared for you. So, before we start, what's going to happen in the next week? Midterms. Midterms. Muddy, old, heater, lock up. There's the end of the day. Let's do it. Okay. Let's see. Midterms. It seems like we should do some kind of a review session or something. I didn't say I was going to, right? I didn't say I was going to, right? So, no. So, be watching all the post. Maybe. No, maybe. All the post a couple of times where I'll do a review session. And the idea is with Midter, this is kind of a chance to do a tune up to make sure that we're just understanding some of the basics of process flows. And bottlenecks, integrates, and little's law, that's what I think. So, the Midterms is, I'll vote some example questions from Ricky here. The Midterms, it's like a multiple choice film like, in the Justin Seller and Bolognese. Who we are has never been to the Justin Seller. Oh my gosh. What? You can either influence. Good luck. It's the most holy place on me in this. Shame, shame, shame. The whole irony is, I actually had, for a summer, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my essay board met. We had a Saturday in that. That's true. I don't think I like cognitively difficult to, like, get my head around like, I leave you a spring ever. I feel good. But I still get the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole place on campus. It is, it's a lot more apparent. There's a lot more. I have good stories from the lessons that I'm raising. So, so we'll do some reviews. That's just that. That's makeover here. That's all I like. Of course. So, we've got to, we've got to get our heads around cranberries here. In order to start us off, that's not maybe, uh, we're getting my essay. My essay is on the letter, we're doing, what? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I've been going to all this trouble trying to be like cool. I'm just going to be doing two more. You get a name for the day, you know? Okay. It's a good, younger name. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You probably been pretty familiar with cranberry farming. I know a thing about you about. I've been going to a cranberry farm. I'm not. Okay. Well, we want you to give us a tour. So, I'm going to put this out here. Uh. I love Virginia Peppies. It's a lot of different types of things. I'm like, what? I have a wanted it. I need to go get another one. So, that's why I was like, did you see really fun stuff? Okay, okay. There we go. Correct. That's it. Did you guys watch this? Yeah. You watch this or what? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. What are we seeing here? Oh, okay. Drowning the field so they can get a very good out there. I thought that cranberries just grew in water. They don't? Maybe they do. No. Okay. So, why is there water here? You see that? Yeah. So, it makes it easier to pick. And then, so, and then, it gives high yield, like, about 20% greater. Cool. Okay. So, these cranberries grow these little bushes. And then, at a certain point, we flood the field. And then, Alex is making the international symbol for a machine that does what? It shakes it. It shakes it. It shakes it. Was there a conference talk? Did you get a cherry tree tree? Yeah. It's just saying, kind of, yeah. It's got a cool, okay? I don't know. That's the one. I do. It would be free to have a long journey before they ever make it here. Yeah, and what's that? It's, uh, even these don't know, these are happening out. Actually, this is a, that might be, but, but, like, this, this is like a bear bell. Oh. It's probably flowing between those steps. Right. Yeah. Uh, holiday plate. Oh, look at that. Oh. Super free, travel long journey before they ever make it to your holiday plate. Yeah. What's that stuff there? It's so cool. We got these, we got, we got, conveyor's flowing. Maybe this thing down here. That might be something that is sorting stuff. I don't know. You get, you get the sense that these things flow through the process. Almost like a, something like a liquid prescribed. Although your cranberry started here in New England on an ocean spray farm. Hi, I'm Allison Carr and I am a six-generation cranberry farmer here in Massachusetts. They're very healthy. The six-generation they've been eating and taxing and very... She looks pretty skinny. And you are on my family farm. Headquartered and laid filmed. That's, those are the bushes of the cranberry, uh, and there. They're growing there. Massachusetts, oceans spray harvest 220... You see why it's not super useful to talk about for chunks. Yeah. Because you have like, what's the hurt of time, so we're making 220 dozen of these things a year. What's the hurt of time of a cranberry like passing one of these steps? No, that's how that's going to go. I just think about this like almost as often as a journey before they ever make it. Look at that flow of cranberries. You're really zoom in, like let it up, that's all. That's fuck. You'd be like, what's the time between cranberry and arrival? Just wait out. That's like, what is it? It's like a mills. I'll make mills, I can't pull these things out. Yeah, so why do we not do that? No, that's what we don't do that. So what's the alternative? So we do it by the barrels? Yeah, so it's like barrels per hour is what we're going to use to make our stuff here. I don't know if there's a rule of thumb about when to do a cycle time or when to do output rate. But cycle time generally we're going to use for a little bit more, like a perchunkey pen and things. We're making cars. Generally, they're perchuncten in most modern factories is around one minute. Usually if you go into a factory, you're going to see a Toyota factory or a Ford factory or whatever you're going to see about. Isch about every minute, a car's going to come up. It might be every 30 seconds, it might be every two minutes. What do you think the perchunkey is being for Bentley? Well, Bentley. Yeah, Bentley. Abendlin, I don't know how to do that. Yeah, what do you think? Does that go up factory and they're making like, you know, a day? It's going to be more like every couple hours, like for a day, maybe a couple hours, maybe an hour. What do you think perchunkey is for flowing somebody's stuff? Not a year. No, that's a throughput time. What took her time to, you think, going mile on factory, let's say we're making three hundred. Seven hundred, seven hundred, seven hundred a year, that's really good. What do you think perchunkey is for? It's about every day that line goes for problems. That's why. Which one? What would they make? I don't know. Cool? Why did you get it? So we're going to make this in, what's bubble bubble? Bubble bubble. It's up to three. Serals for hours. I like that stuff. Serals for hours. Okay, try to time this. Are we going this so far? It's very picturesome. Can you work with perchunkey? Think it's your holiday play. I think. Although your cranberry started here in New England. On a variety of spots, Ocean's Bury Harvest 220 billion cranberries a year. Cranberries are apparently harvested in the water. Despite what people think they don't grow in water at all here. Cranberries begin as vines and wetland fields called a bog. In June, small pink flowers bloom. It said the flowers look like the crane, giving the bear its name. Around late June, the flowers fall off and the actual cranberry starts to grow. Harvesting happens between September and October. When the bogs are filled with a... Let's do whatever's in. Oh, I just love this. This is a waxing toilet. This shizzes makes me happy. What is it that makes me happy? I just want to swim in that. I just want to walk through that so badly. It'll fly through the roof. I have that. Yes, that's army to swim in. You know that these massive sliders are in water. Oh, yeah. Hey, exact. Exacto fruner tree. And I need to be said at the right time. I'm so happy for that. Of course. I think that's her favorite word. I'll probably help her. I'll just put a little bit of water in the water. A very big machine. What's that? Rise. The bog turns up the vines to knock the berries off. Because cranberries have four air pockets inside, they float to the surface of the water. We try to use mother nature as much as we can in the wind. And in a lot of cases, the cranberry will be pushed to one area of the bog. And that's the area we use to take the cranberry bog. A couple more inches of water are added to the bog. And this is where you've probably seen images of farmers thigh deep in cranberry water. Dressed in waiters, farmers maneuver what's called a boom to corral the berries into one corner of the bog. They then rake all the berries into backings and suck them up into the backs of trucks. How many barrels are in a truck? That would be four. Hold up. Dry one. It's a 250 full of that one. It's four hundred. That's a 75. 75. 75. So the trucks that make up, they say 75 years ago, they're unloading. The trucks are sent off to the oceans for a processing plant where they're unloaded. Those berries can become one of one that-brave crippled. And it's just as there was a house where it was almost 65 for a sparkler. For a frame. And while back making. Okay, cool. Why are you sure you're brown? I'm like, terrible at stuff. Fire? I'm just trying to get well. That's not. Okay. What's the, what's that challenge right now? So all the trucks that get backed up, the farmers not happy, the aim of the drivers, and they just stare on the tangerine and then they just wait and see. Okay. So, uh, we're open. The thing is like, that issue. That's the issues. And we'll just abandon it. Okay. So, we've got this, we've got this, is the main growing or shrinking? The demand is growing. Who's followed as that? I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. No. Black bond. You're on Broadway, not. We are on Guillermo of Rock NOWBAR. And we're close. No, there are holes. Physical? No. Bro, I'm scared. You don't want to tell him why, over here in Fort Worth. No. Black is what? For our life. The hole is real,. That's how hard it is. Uh, who else is, please understand, apple buy me. He didn't know that, I can't count alcohol on it. One who really, just give it gold gold. Niche plant in New England, nobody really cared about, and then, you know, all of the years, my bond came along and figured out a way to like, if people would demand these things. That's all right. Thanks, good evening. Now, I mean, there are other things. So, there's lots of good stuff you need to remember, it's work. But they figured out how to like, get the stuff marketed, and so demand's grown, and it's grown a lot, and we've got this problem at the factory right now, which is, you say Tinder, what, yeah? Who's on Tinder, the drivers? Okay, so trucks drive up to the factory, and then what happens? They test them out, and then they drop it at, well, they take it up from the field, and then they drive up to the factory, yeah. And then, they just win in line, but none know what they win in line, and probably just fall on Tinder, and that's not what I'm going to play for us. The car, the car is only got the car. So, they're on, so we've got, we've got waist tag here, and we've got, you know, we want to like, be a little bit expansive about this. We've got, so, like, a shifting technology. What's the history of reforming versus reforming? So, okay, drives harvest things, it's like, pan-picked, it's pretty good, but it's slow, so wet, and one, the blunt field, it gets 20% higher yield, but it can cause some damage, and shorten the time, just that harvest. So, this is cool, like, historically, we've got a change in technology, might be like, why is this such an old case? Why haven't we done something about, like, software development and such, and that's a challenge for you. I want you to just be thinking today about what are the analogs for the carol on the tree, and something like that, as well. Okay, there's some actually really cool carol. So, we've got, we've got this shifting technology, we've got a problem where we're causing our suppliers to back up, like, just a challenge, and we're going to have to, like, dive into the process to figure out what to do. Cool? Okay. Okay, who has, like, a process flow chart that they're really proud of? Yeah. Alex, show us yours. I'm trying to raise. If it's a bit of full of them. Oh, that's right. Oh, wow. Flash it around. Very cool. Very solid line. Oh, yeah. Jan, that's yours. Very small, but. Don't you want to try this? Where was that? One of those backers. Really? Can I see it? It's color coded. Yes. I never use that level of technology. Okay. Okay. Holy cow. Oh, yeah. It's all right. Good. Alex and Jan, like, this is great. Yeah. That was his team effort. That was the effort. Oh, sorry. Okay, we're going to have to do without that then. Okay. Then. Yeah. What's that supposed to say? Just get your hands shut. Okay. Jan, I'm going to do, oh, by the way, I missed it. Please. What? I'm sorry. Get through. I threw it at the end. I was just trying to get it. Oh. Oh. I'm ready. I'm going to throw it at the end. Okay. Don't do it on me. Who can break this thing, really? I'm sorry. I said, I have a special question for you. I'll be sure. Okay. Sorry. We got our trucks. Jan, they come at the load. We've got a way and test. And then we've got our Hawaii numbers. Going Greg, we're going to have to check this for a long time. I mean, that's the however I used to have Hawaii numbers and Gmail.com is an email address. A little bit of a flex. A little bit of a flex. I can't go up to your two about. Oh, my goodness. Hey, the whole chance is gone. From that, there are three possible bins. The types of bins that we go to. We've got our dry wet and our dry wet. Now this looks like a Hawaii virus. Then on the dry side, we go to the dry side. We go to the east stone. Jan, what are you suppose to do still? We take out the rest of the stuff. Let's figure it. We take out little rocks. Little rocks. Why don't they have to do that on the outside? It's already been a water and airing out. Yeah, how? Things that they were in the water. Water is heavy. What is it? Greg, what's this? Oh, so ultimately stones, they weigh a lot. They will sink. They will sink. The cameras go up and they will suck it up with the vacuum. So that's what he made, by the way. What's that? That's what he made. I like it. I like it. Okay. So then they go to DJ shops. That's that. And then they go to the jumbo separator. All right. Okay. And then we go on the wet side of the factory. Jan, what do we go to first? From the wet side. From the dry side. No, that's that. So we're going to DJ first. And then we dry air. And then we go back to the separate. Okay. Are we cool so far? We're going to get some numbers on this. Me, five. You're a GDFD. Who else? The other three are you. Go with Thomas. We will be equal. Exactly. Okay. I want you to use your lawyer and everybody else. We're going to go to the separate. But we're going to listen to her language very carefully. And my language very carefully. Try to identify what it is that I say is wrong. It's been the question I asked. Cool. Try to like pick apart my language. To go suing me. As I asked, Jan, first. Okay. Jan. Let's start off with the dry side of the factory. I have a mind to stay here, but we're about to. Okay. What we're going to try to do is put some numbers to these processes. So let's start with the first user. I went with the numbers. The numbers, okay. That's cool. I like it. Okay. Now let's move on. That's good for you. Okay. Listen carefully. Jan, what's the capacity of those of the driving? The driving's 250. Do you have 50 barrels? How many? 16. 16. And that gives us how many? 4,000. Somebody blow it out or that. 4,000 for the end? Yes. Okay. I like it. So what's the capacity of the driving? 4,000. Okay. What is wrong with my question? I just asked. Pass me. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So we got some of these that are dry wet. That's cool. Silvan. You're going to do it. You're going to do it. That was the second silvan. I'm just going to add it to the other silvan. Yeah. That's a good answer. I thought what I was going to do was it's so good answer. Joseph, what is wrong with the wording that I used to ask? This is a fourth point actually. It's not like I'm being funny. What question did I ask, Jan? I never imagined that. What's the capacity of the driving? What's wrong with the way I ask that question? It's a good question. I'm wondering if it has some food like this. The process later down the line. Oh, that's good. Yeah, we're going to bump into something later on. I like it, Chase. The capacity, it makes it seem like it's something that's actually productive in the process. We're just storing something. JD, is that what you're going to say? Yeah. Okay. Think about this. I just used this fourth capacity in this context. I asked, Jim, what's the capacity of the fence? The way the world might use the word, third capacity. There should be, I can see it on the board. It says, if I order a fire cheap, this room has a capacity of like 80. No, no. That's what we're talking about here when we talk about capacity. When we talk about capacity in this class, James, what are we talking about? The amount of productivity that we have. Like it's able to do. JD, what would we, what? So, this doesn't have like 4,000 barrels per hour. These bins are not going to have like a tank of volume. JD, what would it be more appropriate? What would be a better word to use rather than capacity? What I'm expressing inventory. Inventory whip. I like it. It's totally right. Any other thoughts? Oh, I see. Christy says volume. As measuring what? BBL. You can just count barrels. BBL doesn't wait on. BBL doesn't wait on. Okay. This is a lot more like volume of whip. These things, this is just barrels. And this is more like volume. When we talk about capacity in this class, capacity is going to be units per time. It sounds a lot like something we've talked about before. Call this like an ideal output rate. It's like if we were unconstrained, what would our capacity? What would that output rate be? That's capacity. It's the inverse of what, Chase? Cycle type. Cycle type. Cycle type. Jack was muddled up here. No, no, it's good. It's good. It's good. Sorry. Oh, it's good. I'm going to try to fix your one. Output rate is units per time. And Jack, cycle time is... Per chunk time or time per unit. Time per unit. They're just inverses of one. Cool? Pretty cool. Okay. Gen, rearticulate if you would back to me. What's wrong with the... I said, what's the capacity of the drive bends? What's wrong with what I said? Well, it's not like it units per time, so it can't be. Yeah. If I were to look at these things, what do they look like? I don't understand the question. If I were to look at a drive bend, what would it look like? Just a little cream. It just holds up. It probably has an accident at the bottom of it. And you shovel stuff in there. It's not doing any processing. All of this is just like a holding area. It's a waiting room for the rest of the place. Cool? And our assumption is they can just process through stuff. Instantaneously, if there's room there, it's partly not to say capacity. But if there's volume there to take, it'll take the process. Down here, go to the process structure. Okay, cool. Okay. Gen. What's the... I'm going to use the word correctly now. What's the capacity for an e-stone? For the de-center, it's 1,500 barrels per hour per each of the three. Three. So that's what's the total capacity there? 4,500 barrels per hour. Brails per hour. Okay. What do I have to be shaking? That is the same. No, we've got... Sorry, we've got one of these developed to slide and two of these developed to wet. Well, yeah, but overall... Overall, that's fair. We're going to split this up. That's the capacity of 1,500 barrels per hour. And then, what's the capacity of the geobo-separator? That one is 400 barrels per hour. And there's three of those as well. So that's 100 barrels per hour. 200 barrels per hour. Okay. Now, I want you to look at what Gen's got as to here. Gen. So we said... There's 80,000 barrels a day coming in. But we're going to just assume that that's spread evenly over 11 hours. It's not fully there. But it's probably what's happening now. But we're just going to assume that that's the arrival rate of those trucks. 1600-36 barrels per hour. Then, so, 18,000 by another. That's what's coming in. That's split 30-70 between dry and wet. So the dry... We're just going to assume here if you want to get more precise later we can. But we're going to assume then that there's 491 barrels of dry cranberry is per hour coming in. Gen, what do you visualize? Like, what's going to happen if we're asking this process, this site, the factory, the process of 491 barrels per hour? I don't know. I'm going to go on. It's pretty fast. Yeah. So this river dry comes in. It's the burden up here. It goes, can de-stoning? Does it have capacity to handle four or anywhere per hour? Yeah. Like, oh yeah. Yes, over here. Why do they have 10X the capacity that it means? I guess in the past, they just have more time. That's interesting. Does that reconcile with you? We know about the case. Yeah. So they've actually... You probably have this problem, the store of R-tapped. We have tons of capacity on the dry side. And like, as we're moving away from dry, clearly have that. Okay, then we can de-chaping, handle four or anywhere per hour, 3X, it's the inner-dime gap. And then we're going to go to jumbo separator. We're going to... 1200, minus 491. Somebody calculate where we really quick? 709. What is it? 709. Okay, so we got 491. We're asking, you said 709. So we're going to ask this thing to process 491. We're going to ask this one to... This side... Sorry, Brent asked to jump with separate devices. 491 per hour per hour. That means 791 barrels wet barrels per hour capacity on this side. Cool? Okay. Jen? You got it? Okay. What's the... Well, what's the capacity of the wet drive-ins, Jen? What's the volume? What's the wet or volume? Volume of those bins. Okay, dry wipe is wet? 2000. 2000. Okay, so it's 250 barrels and 1 total and 2000 barrels. Okay, kind of eight. This is that. It equates to 2000. And then this one is what? That one's 400 barrels and total it's 1200 barrels. 1200 barrels. It's just not for hours, it's a VBL. Okay, and then what's our capacity in the heat chase step? Okay, so that one we are looking at 3000 because there's two. Okay, then what about the driver? 600 because there's three. Three times 200. It was 600 barrels per hour. Okay, now final question I guess I asked to Jen is we're asking the wet side of the factory to process how many barrels per hour? 1145. 1145 barrels per hour. You got a river? Hey, just two rivers kind of in the factory. The more anyone goes that way, it's drying. 1145, which is not magic, we just calculated, but by kicking a thousand right by a little bit. And then time is 0.7. And they're going to say this, so we're asking this to process 1145 barrels per hour this time. Jen, can the DJ handle 1145 barrels per hour? How much extra capacity does it have? Almost three times. Okay, now we're going to get the driver. That's where we have a bottle of that. So we're trying to push 1145, imagine a river of cranberries, we're trying to push 1145 into it, but it can only take 600. So at least 600 is going to get through here. General separator can handle that, it can handle 700. Okay, this is a really important visualization question. I'm going to ask for your thoughts on it. What happens when that river of 1145 hits the dryer almost instantly in the morning? Some of you probably worry like, how much wind is there between steps? We're going to assume that that river is just going really fast and there's not like width, pilot, between steps. It just hits this constriction of dryer almost immediately. What's going to happen as soon as I keep seeing like, there's a very like spread, like a... manually expressive area over here. General is going like this and Corbin is going like this. What's going to happen? Corbin, what happens in the traffic jam? So you will like this, what does that mean? Well, I'm saying it would stop. It doesn't stop. Well, sure. Pilot, yeah, it's not. It piles up. We've got like eight lanes going down the freeway. We shut down like six of them. We're still getting through. It just came through to much slower rate than what's arriving. What happens then to the rest of the cars when that happens on the freeway? What's that? No, they don't stop. They're really crazy. They arrive at the river. This happened to be over the weekend. Driving so late, going on for like eight or five miles an hour, it'll be about myself. Five. Ninety, sorry. Who's along? And the life freezer. Are you ever to babies? You don't go down here. You're the problem. I'm going like I'm on the freeway. All these lanes are on like 90. There's different bodies over there when it's easy to buy. Who's along? In all seriousness, Corbin, there's like a slowdown, because there's like a cop park at the side and everybody likes us. Visualize this. The freeway can no longer process this string of cars going really fast. We slow down to 20 miles an hour. They don't stop. You probably could stop something. But just slow down to 20. What happens to the freeway back behind us? Just a good time to drive. And what if you were like watching us from a helicopter, you get you arrive at this slow spot and you got tons of people rushing to get to the general conference. What happens to the slowdown? What happens to the slowdown? Just progressively. Yeah, so watch this from above. You see the first car that rises at that slowdown? That's what you're saying. Corbin, what I was asking you to do. Are we going to have a problem today? What? Make a big noise. Santa, I got a quiz for you, Corbin. No one else. The first person that rises at that thing just goes, whoa, I just dodged that. I just zoom through it. Somebody who rises a minute later, arrives at a big slowdown ahead. If you ride like 10 minutes later, if you look at it from above, what is the snake of stuff look like here, Ben? The slowdown keeps going. That's slowdown, back, step, and back, step, and back. That's kind of what this is going to look like here. Caroline, what were you doing like this? No, it was a backlog. Backlog. Backing out. In the factory. Caroline, where's it going to back up to first? So, first because if the dryer was a bottom, like here, it will be the D shape first. Yeah, and I'm going to just say something that maybe like, if this like immediately works for you, absorb it and love it, if it doesn't immediately work for you intuitively, just right down and talk to your group on this later. I'm going to say that the D-chaping area has like no real volume in it. All of this is like a blow dryer, a gate that cranberries pass through, and it takes off the husk of the cranberry. So there's no real room in the end for those cranberries. Like pile up inside the D-chaping. It just zooms past like a gate here. Alex, Alex, Alex, rocked it. Okay, Carol, so if cranberries are restricted here, we're backing up here, where are they going to start to pile up? So this is like if we're doing wet pile up here, it's in the holding bins here. It's going to start piling up here, and then where you suppose it's going to pile up after that. Depending on if we try with a dry and wet, that will be a part of it. We're going to be smart to both all of our capacity. No. Please dance. We're going to do all that volume to probably wet if we're being smart. And then where is it going to go, Carol? Go back to the dumpster and the truck's ultimate. It's going to start piling up the outing to the parking lot. Yeah. Or cool with that, Christian. This may be as a matter, so stop me for a minute. But like the comparable that go between the speed that you're going, does it not matter? Like how would they slow down? You have two questions there. First, I'm going to just put the sake of assumption here. And this is a little bit unreal, but it's close to real. I'm going to say that there is like a conveyor belt that goes between all these steps. But you saw those cranberries going fast on the conveyor. It's kind of like almost instantaneous that it goes from one step to the other. And there's not like a lot of volume on any of those belts. I think at a time there's probably just like maybe half a barrel of cranberries on any belt. But there's just zooming fast. That's part of your question. The other part of your question, Christian, look, it's back on you. Let's say there's like this dial on each of these machines. And what we said is we're going to turn this machine up like come back. And what's its flow rate going to be when we crank it up? We're going to try to just max the output of this thing for our turn of defend. Cool. Christy, if you're in charge of the dial, the teaching machine, we're even going to set it to run out. Oh yeah, 600. Why? Wait, I thought you were a winner. Oh, why would you, you could hang up to 3,000. Yeah, but then they all go overflown and you close up. Okay, so you've got to match. Well, that was my question. Is there a manual component to that? I don't know, I just paid this part up. It works out. I see you control, like you know from the day you say, we're only going to be 600. Yeah. Who are our nerd engineers in here? Jacob. I'm a Jacob. Charles, if a Jacob, Brad, do you, Brad, do you have a name? Yeah, I'm Brad. I'm Brad. They want what they're in their head. They're like, oh my gosh, this would be so cool. I'm going to buy a Raspberry Pi controller with an input that senses like the backup of the previous thing. I'm going to program a controller that sets that thing on that. That's so true. And I'm saying it's cheaper to just hire Christy. Oh, I don't know. She's expensive. That's not like a problem. Yeah, that's not a control stuff. It's like super expensive. It's like millions of dollars. Although, you know, because the entire thing is worth thousands of dollars a dollar. That's right. They can't get an engineer to program this up and have it like chronographically based. Or you can have a person do this more shadow. Toyota case, we're going to do it in a while. We're going to actually probably some of the stuff manual. Because if we had to go back and like reprogram that Raspberry Pi game, or if we brought it to like, like, Christy, we wanted part of our job was to help develop Christy's brain as a person working in the line. We might actually not automate stuff because we want to keep her like nose in the problem so that she saw the problem rather than like outsourcing to her. And Toyota will actually do that. So that's cool. So two parts of your mind. Okay. We got a problem here. Carolyn and Corbin say, cranberry's in here. They can only flow through at 600. They're flowing in at 11.5. It starts it back up, it piles up here, then it backs up into the parking lot. A little analogy we are going to do here. Who feels a little like? Just a touch like half lost. But they're still feeling like they want to hang in there and like raise their hand and help us walk through something. This requires both vulnerability and sendiness. Peter! Peter! Peter! Here's our model we're going to use to think of this. Oh, I can't. Oh, no. Oh, Peter! Here's the model we're going to use to this. Oh, is that one of those? I'm so afraid. You're never going to get that back. Yeah, do it. Let's jump. Just try to get, try to get, try to get. Yeah! What is going on? I'm going to hold that down there. I don't know. You can have a lock in. You can have a lock in. Peter! In our little analogy we're going to use here. We got a, what is this thing? I'll tell you. They got a bathtub. Yes, old bathtub one. And we've got a, a, a spigot here with our, a, or the control of how much water flows in. And then we've got our faucet here. And we're going to put into the bathtub. We're going to flow into the bathtub water. And in our analogy here, how best you want to flow it in. Okay, six, six hundred is really good. That's going to be a different thing here. That's going to be exit of the bathtub. So this bathtub is going to, lose water and raise 600 barrels per hour. That's how much you can take for you. But we're asking the bathtub, we're going to flow in how much? I think it's going to be. Initially more, but actually we want to have a lot of it. Okay, so this is good. This is really, really good. Peter, thank you for playing along. What rate are we flowing in? What cranberries at? We're just, we're just going to pay attention to the wet side of the factory, not the threat side. What is the rate in which we're, that river is coming into the process? We're going to be 45. Okay, so here's our one to be Peter. We're going to have water flow into the bathtub at a rate of plus 11, 45 barrels per hour. And we can take out a bathtub 600 barrels per hour. Are we cool? So what's going to happen to the water of the bathtub over time? It's like a little bit of water. Okay, so we're going to have the water level in the bathtub. It's going to go up. Like we can take out less than we can put in. It's going to go up. And what's the rate like the accumulation rate of water in the bathtub? What's the rate which is going to increase? It's the volume of water in there. Yeah, is it? How did you calculate that? I'm thinking a little 45 minus 600. Yeah, so the accumulation right here is 11, 45 minus 600, which is going to be 545 barrels per hour, is the rate which this is going to rise. Is that cool? Nerd engineers don't worry about the head pressure on the drain. We're going to assume that it's just constant. Great. Okay. Are we cool? Peter, at what point is the bathtub going to overflow? You mean at what time? It depends. How would we figure out when the bathtub is going to overflow? It's been longing the bathtub. Oh, we got. Like we're about per hour. Yeah, so whatever volume this tub can handle, at some point this is going to go up at 540 bit per hour, and then it'll overflow. It'll see the volume of the bathtub. In our analogy here, if these things are the bathtub, once we overflow our capacity, volume, once we overflow the volume here, where is the cranberry going to go? In my next... Backing the Dr. Zabak and the Dr. Zabak and the Dr. Zabak's pile up. And that's our... This game, this identified this is like more of a problem, that are... At some point, we overfill our volume of our wind, J in the factory, and then we spill over into the parking lot, and that two of the trucks is going to get longer in the parking lot, which is a problem. Are we cool with that? Okay. Any questions? Okay. Maybe we're going to keep going? Yeah. Okay. So, here's what I want us to do. We can actually, if you think about this, we can actually like, express what we've just talked about graphically. Genio question? No? Okay. We can express this graphically, and look at over time, what happens to width of cranberries, someplace in the factory, and see like, at what point we start to overflow these bins, and get into the parking lot, we can even probably calculate, like how long the trucks will wait. So, let's do this. I'm going to break these things off. Does anybody even use these? Yes. Who? Everybody use these. You are a leader. You're much a doob. Okay. Maybe you use it. We might use these. Maybe you might use these. I just think about it in six video hours. Okay. Peter, we're going to, here's what we're going to do. On our graph. Our zero would have started there. This is going to be hours in the day. Oh, man. I can see that. Cool. It's ready to be. Hold it really fast. You can see that. It's okay. Okay. All right. Back. Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Hours the day. And what we're going to do, on the y-axis here, is, Who said volume? Good job. Okay. So, we're going to call this volume of cranberry width. And we're going to call this volume of In barrels. Somewhere on site. That's a very, very good. Well, the reason I'm being kind of like, small sea Catholic, where I definition here, is that we're going to, we're going to define width as like cranberry's somewhere. There might be in the bins, there might be trucks, but it's going to be like, somewhere on premises. That's our, that's cool. Okay. Here, using our analogy here, what time do we actually start? 7 a.m. This gets a little bit to, kind of the Chrissie's question, we're going to just assume that our problems start immediately. Because there's like, the conveyor belt is going really fast, and there's no like actual volume inside of the dechanging and de-stoning. So this river of 1145 starts, hits dryer, essentially instantaneously. It probably, in reality, takes a few minutes, but hits it, and then the cranberry start to pile up. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Where do we, how many barrels of cranberry do we have on site? Five. How do you calculate that? That's amazing. The bathroom. The bathroom. Okay. So after this is right, 545, Peter got that by doing 11, 45, minus 600, equals 545, where only we're hour of accumulation. We're going to end up with fun sites of work. This is a little bit childish to do this, but for those of you who don't think graphically, here's the way I think about this. This is literally, if you go out at hour one and take a snapshot, you're going to see 545 barrels of cranberries piled up, probably where, here, back to our own one. In the wet holding bins, it's probably where we put it. They're flowing almost instantaneously, even through the quality dumpers. Those are actually a process. They're not really like a holding thing. They're zoomed through there. After hour two. 1090. That's how much. How many barrels of cranberries we have on premises this summer? OK, are we cool so far? We said we're going to have trucks arriving for 11 hours. So in hour 11, we're going to keep this flow going. Let's say we're a meter. That's hour 11. So we have the calculator help. Don't learn it out, but here goes the math. How much is it? What is it? 545 times 11. 545 times 11 is what? Somebody help them out? 595. 59.95. Bananas? Yes. No. You almost slipped. 59.95. Volume? Yeah, barrels. It's an impressive volume. 5.95. Barrels of cranberries somewhere. OK, are we cool so far? Does anybody have any questions? Where are we at? Here, at what point in the day do we overfill the bins? We got wet and dry and wet. We're going to overfill the bins. And then we start to back up the problem into trucks in the parking lot. You said the numbers don't count. Yeah, they don't count. So if we're just doing the talking left, then the 2,000 plus both hundred. By the way, sorry. He's going to help us with a math problem here really quickly. He said, what did you say? What's the number thing? As you know, volume. 4 shallow to the last five minutes of class. We're going to probably figure out something about the dumpers in white over there. And it's going to be stupid. But we're going to get there just in a little while. You're not going to get smart, but then we're going to get there. OK, pure. At what point do we overfill the bins? You said, how much is the total capacity? 32. Volume. 32. 3200. Those are bins. It's going to be, let's say it's like here, 3200. How many hours into the day is that? 6. 3, 3, 2, 3, 5. Yeah. So this is 3200. Somebody help us out here? 545 is what? 5.1. 5.1. 870. 5.872 hours into the day. So we got this river coming in. 5.872 hours of the day. We see these bins filling up, filling up, filling up, filling up, filling up, filling up, filling up. And then at that point, hour of 5.88 is when the problem spills over into the trucks. And so if a truck arrives, so this truck driver arrives here, they have no wait time. There's room for the cranberries. If a truck driver arrives here, let's see what happens. They're going to sit there and wait. What? Hopper was only. Hopper was only. Which truck driver has the most time to browse farmer's only? Don't worry about it. How are you going to do that? I've been in the last four years. The one that arrives at 6 p.m. 11 hours after 7 p.m. So 6 p.m. So you had some delay like your truck would start out of the field. Or the dump farmer was like sloping your truck loaded. You arrived at 6 p.m. John, how long does that four big truck driver have to serve farmers only before they can actually unload their intake 5.1, 2.8 hours? How did you get that? That's from the 5 minutes already back. I'm just going to think of the time you got there. OK, now you're close, but here's what we got to do. The company is. Let's continue this line. This is like a water level of the bath, though. John, what happens to this line was going in plus 5.45. What happens is the line starting at this point. It starts going down. It starts going. OK, so this goes down at 600 barrels per hour. So we no longer have an inflow. All we have is an outflow. We turn it off the spigot under that tub. It now just drains it to 600 per hour. We're taking it out. And then John, this is the point where this guy is going to rise here for a lady. It gets to actually dump the truck. They get to actually dump their truck. And they wait for hell on them. How would you calculate that? That's 8.28 27.90. How did you get 59.95 minus 32.00. 32.00. So this wait time from here to here is 4.66. Is that right? Is that right? Hours, that's correct. What's that? That's correct. OK, now. So there's a couple of ways to skin this cat. Sorry, Paige. Do we like a new album or not? Yeah, sure. It's growing on me. I know, I know, but it's growing on me. It's just me. And doctorate yourself enough. Do you like it? OK, so no, we don't. We don't. We don't. We just have to wait for it. Taylor or compilate? Yeah. Sure. Hey, John says somebody who buys his exactos is a tractor every year. I said wait at all. The tractor every year. I said like the longest way is going to be 4.66 hours. We actually calculate the average wait time in the number of trucks. It's kind of an easier way to do this. Anybody think about what does area of those triangles represent? This is like actually kind of a philosophical question. Anybody, what is it? It's the surface berries. It's the surface berries. OK, so here's what I like where you're headed. Think about this. So y-axis has berries, barrels of berries. But you got to incorporate in your answer the exactos. Because there's like a time component to this. So keep going. What is like area represent? Yeah. V, Z, volume of cranberry looks per hour. Yeah, like by... Yeah, like how it's... How it's called is like a barrel hour, which is actually kind of a hard thing to run your head around? Here's an easier thing to calculate. Let's see. Really quickly. This actually we can do this. How would we calculate the area of that triangle? One and a half. Many times I. So the height of this is... What? 60 or 59 or 5? My is 3200. Right? Is that the height? Yeah. Corbin's offended by the use of j-a-t. Good bye. So offended by the use of j-a-t. You're right. 59, but that's the height. And then whatever the base of this is, somebody calculated whatever that is. How many hoppers? Oh, yeah. It's... What is minus 5? 5.1. That height? 9.7. Okay. Is that right? This would be just... There's no like magical calculus here. This is literally just subtracting whatever this is. Yes, that is a little stopper. Is that right? What's that? Don't say that. The big triangle. The big triangle. Yeah, that's 9.10. Okay, so we're going to do 0.5 times 9.7 times whatever. 29.9. 27.95. Okay, and that's going to equal 1. So we're going to total weight 13. What is this? Total weight. It's just what's the actual number? 13.681. 13.681. We're going to call this a barrel hour. 16.1381. Barrel hours. I don't... Me, like... I really like what you said. Actually, I actually don't know if 13.681 barrel hours are. It's easier for me to get my head around. I can work that if you track hours. How do we convert 13.681 barrel hours into truck hours? You can cross it by the average truck load. Which is... That's it. So multiply it by... This is barrel hours of area here. Let's divide by 75 barrels per truck. What's 13.681. 182... 182... Okay, this is... I can't give my head around. This is 182.4 truck hours. So, the cool thing about what this graph is doing for us is it's allowing us to see... Like, how many hours of truck pile up we have? Some place on site over the course of the day? How much need by this... 182.4 truck hours cost us? We're customer supplyers. About $100 an hour. About $100 an hour. This is about $10 an hour. Maybe that's... I think that's the right time. Down. What? Okay, that's $100 per hour. So this is... 182.220... 40... $100... $100... Or banana? He's just $100 an hour. Yeah, we had this... We had this... This is about an 18.4 hour in a day. So, let's... Okay. Nevi is at a lot of work. Compared to the amount that they're working at. The grouping was like $60,000 for the dryer. Okay. What Nevi just said is... It's costing us in truck driver week time. $18,000 a day. We could fix that by buying... How much does the dryer cost? $60,000. A $60,000 piece of equipment... I'm not Ben, I ever said... Roughly speaking, what's the payoff period then? We're worried about it. Do we like investments that pay off in Britain? Yes. Yes. Genives the thumbs up. Yeah, that's probably a slim jump. We probably have to think of some of the stuff that's slim up. Okay, now we have some cool stuff to think about here. What happens to our line? John, let's just go back to you. What happens to our line if we buy another dryer? So the upward line is going to be less steep. Yeah, good. Yeah, it's going to be less steep. So another dryer that's going to get us to what? $845. It's going to be $800. For us driver, it's going to be $25,000. For our accumulation rate, it's going to be $34,000. Rather than $5,000, $45,000, it's going to go like this. And then our... By calculating right before plastic, we're still going to get above the bins a little bit. Is that right, Lindsey? Yeah, it's fine. Okay, and then... Our downward line will be $800. It's going to be like $800. Now, that's cool. So if you want to go home and do this, have fun. And calculate what that little triangle is. Carregulate difference between the big triangle and the little triangle. That's your winnings from buying one more dryer. And that goes into your NP. Have you guys done NPV yet in Benz class? No. Okay, that goes into your net present value calculator in Excel. You buy something for $60,000. And then exchange for $60,000. You get a stream of cash flows. They're like $18,000, whatever $17,000 a day. And then you can calculate whatever, like, what's that worth to you in the project? It's going to be radically positive and awesome. We're going to do that deal all the time. What else? Yes, Sam. Isn't there a problem on the last step? Because we can only do $790. Oh, so then we're going to bump into that. Yeah. So then what do you do? To move. To move. To get your separate. Down, you prioritize the left. So then you do the right to the left for an hour. Yeah, then you do less of the dry. Because they also said they don't care if the dry waits in action. Yeah, cool. Cool. What I like about a lot is that possible we can afford to buy a second dryer. Yeah. So maybe buy a second dryer. And then, oh, no, sorry, sorry. Then we buy another separator. And then we're going to use sometimes in operations this analogy that I'm going to mix in. Yeah. Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to buy you a second dryer. There's an analogy that we'll sometimes use about 90 bottlenecks. And that really has been very close to this metaphor. So just like, forget about what we talked about here. Imagine that you're riding a boat down a river. And you know that they're like rocks. Some are under the surface. Some are sticking out. That's like... What's this, you're up? And you find this rock. That's like our bottleneck. And you go like blow it up or have an excavator come and take that rock out of the river. And then the way you identify the next bottleneck is you lower the water level. And then the next thing that pokes out is this thing. Blow that one up. Blow it again. There's going to be another one that pokes out. So the way you think about dealing with bottlenecks is you sort of serially like general mill serial. Like serially in series deal with bottlenecks. Deal with our main bottleneck is a dryer. Let's address that. The next thing that pokes up is the demo separator. Once we fix that, we're going to see the next thing that pokes up is going to be probably another dryer. And so, okay, is that cool? So, but now we have a way not just to like... Use our intuition and like wave or our hands it. Hey, being able to buy another dryer, we actually have a way to like decide what the investment is worth and what we should be first. And then second and then third. Are we cool with this? Okay, there's a concept for it. Oh, one more thing on our China. What's another important thing that happens with John's second line? This gets us out at about hour 21. That's when we clean all the factories out, we'd yell the water out, start playing blocks around it right next day, 7 am. So, that's at 21 hours in, it's like 4 am. It's only the last person that's going to be out of this plant. Yang talked about trucks kind of laying up in the factory. So, then what's another problem we have? Over time. So, let's assume that we've got an 8 hour shift that ends here, and another shift ends at hour 16. All of the time that we've got people here on the factory, so then what? We're paying time to have, and have people be there. If we could get this line to come back down and get the last cranberry off premises by hour 16, then we solve our overtime problem. And that's another element that we put in like, isn't worth it for us to buy a dryer. Cool? Okay. Now, big picture. Here's a little challenge I have, because I feel like in some ways we've wasted all of our time today. I know, it's really sad. So, sometimes in supply chain or logistics, there's a funny like joke expression that the cheapest warehouse in the world is your supplier's truck or ship. So, the truth is, we don't have to like, I mean, farmers all day is cool. It's actually not costing us anything. We're pushing this problem to our supplier. Why would we actually, do we even care about like buying extra dryers to do this? Jared? I was gonna say this is a fire probably isn't paying anything either, because my community is just that long haul truckers, like don't get paid when they're sitting in line. And so, actually, you're only putting it on the truck drivers. There's no one here who likes to put their shoes on. There's no like, totally. Last, they're the bottom-ear... I wouldn't have said that. I like this. They're giving me ass. They're giving me ass. They're giving me ass. What the fuck? Ben! So, I... Ben! Don't ruin this for me, because I got a fog going on. The truck drivers, I think, are part of the law for this. They're... They're still on there. What's up? Wait, what? So, they're all, you know, this. Who are the dryers employed by? The dryers. The dryers. The farmers are just farmers. Farmers? The dryers. Farmers. Who are the farmers to us? There's the flyers and... Oh no. Monday. There are bosses. They are the ones that are hired. Oh, crap. I know. It sucks. So, we're actually hurting ourselves. And there's a couple of elements of hurting ourselves. Like, we're hurting ourselves by charging our own owners... A bunch of times for their employees to be on farmersonly.com. We're costing over time to ourselves. And the grading thing, and probably some of you, I hope, debated in your study groups a little bit. Everybody get right around the excellent grading cranberries, and cue. James. If we're misgrading cranberries, who gets hurt by that? So, remember what's happening here. We're falsely letting through some crappy cranberries and overpaying some farmers for those. Who gets hurt? We get some repayment. Yeah, specifically. Which of our owners gets hurt by that? And which owners get helped by that? You're a very marker. No, I'm not. Are you? I don't know. You see the question you gave me? James. Yeah. We have just said... You just said... For some of our suppliers, some of our owners, we're falsely letting through crappy cranberries and overpaying for them. Who gets hurt here? I don't know. It's like the... No, it's even more subtle than... Eat it. It's more subtle than that. Who gets hurt? The farmers that actually produce cranberries. It's like a wealth transfer from good farmers to bad farmers because we're not grading carefully. So that's an interesting like governance thing that we're going to have to put on our big kit pants and have a hard conversation with our owners and be like, I don't want to have like a trouble, but some of you are getting overpayed. And it's not like you're getting overpaid by the market. You're getting overpaid by some of your fellow owners. And you're all going to have to like work that out amongst yourselves and we're going to do better and greater stuff. Like that's actually pretty cool. Final question. Who said that? Who said who said who said who said? JD. What's in the back? JD. JD. How do we end up in this state of affairs? What do you think? Like why did we buy last year a whole bunch of co-onigumpers instead of the right thing which is to buy a dryer? Why did we buy this? Yeah, why did we buy all that stupid stuff that doesn't help us at all? All that does is help us with like dumping intake capacity. We don't have our hair. Why did we buy that instead of dryers? That's good. I like that. Keep going. What do you suspect? Carlos? We have a new introducing. What's that? I don't know. We need more cranberries than we do. We did. So historically we're different from what that's fair. Why did we buy all those, Joseph? This is make the drivers feel like we're trying to. Okay, that's good. I like where you're headed, Dad. Gallon? Because someone didn't go to see what was going on. And they said, we have a big backup. So let's put in another bumper because if people aren't dumping fast enough, then let's just dump more. I like this. Somebody went to like half the operations classes. That's the other section. The other... There's a Corbin, man. Somebody went to half of their operations, of course. Corbin. Corbin is amazing. And they remembered in class we said, how do you identify the bottleneck? Is probably where the pileup is. They're like, well the pileup is in the parking lot. That's what we should increase our offloading capacity. Why didn't the pileup appear right where the bottleneck actually is? The bottleneck was James. Hit it. Hit it. Oh, the bottleneck was right as at the... Not a goal. The bottleneck was at the dryer. We thought it was way out in the parking lot. Why did we think it was at the dryer? Lindsey. Because we're going through at a rate rather than like... That's good. I like it. I like we're headed on that. Chrissy. You can like visualize the pileup only where there's whip. But there's not... Why isn't there whip in front of the dryer? Well, yeah, because it's continuous things. Okay, but even more, keep going. Why don't we see the whip at the bottleneck? Why don't we see whip piling up the bottleneck? Selvin. Because if we said that each half are really high, we'd be losing barriers before we get to the dryer. Okay. Having a big mess. So we fixed that mess and we make it like... I like that a lot. Lately? You could almost think of it as one process because like multiple books said like once you get out of that with the whip, it just goes. So that is the... That is the whip for the dryer. We had this like kind of flexible hose and we squeezed it at the dryer. It's only lit through 600. And the only place that we have allowed it to pile up, there's actually no place for it to pile up inside the factory. The only place for it to pile up is out in the parking lot. And if we weren't like super careful about our analysis, we'd be... Oh, the bottleneck is at the parking lot at the dumpers. It's actually deeper in the system. But because it's kind of like Tashiba, where the bottleneck is actually deeper in the line, but we constrained everything to not let whip pile up anywhere, except at the very beginning. And that's where it piled up. So we didn't do it careful enough cases. I have my guess and you don't know this for sure. But my guess is whoever did the analysis on this last year, erroneously identified the dumpers as the bottleneck, because that's where the pilot was happening. They didn't actually do the analysis to figure out that it's at the dryer. And it's just manifesting itself. The problem is the symptoms actually don't manifest themselves except out in the parking lot. So if we did a smart job, we could do that. You can figure out how much to spend, and then we'd be all set. It would be really great. Okay. Any final... Sylvan, was there any final question or... Come on. Okay. Kristi? Would there be any list of everyone like incorporating whip on purpose? Like, could you insert some whip before the dryer? Kristi. Oh. That's what it is now. I know we're a minute over. I'm going to just take two more minutes to torture Kristi, because it sounds like fun. Kristi. If we put a bin, a wet bin right before the dryer, what would happen to it? And we turned on the system, what would happen to that dryer? What would happen to that bin right before the dryer? When? Immediately. Well, we're close. Whatever that bit back will fill up. How big of a bin would you have to make if you want to do this like all season and just run it continuously? Oh, like infinity. Like infinity. Now, if there were something where we were like, you know what, let's let that bin fill up. It's really, really expensive to buy a dryer. Maybe we could let's fill up right before the dryer, and then have like a part-time person added to the dryer. They could like, over the course of the day, I think it'd fill up, and they could draw it back down and fill up, draw it back down. That might make sense, but for right now, it doesn't make sense to put a bin there, because if a process is imbalanced, imbalanced meaning one goes faster than the other, our bins are just going to fill up to infinity. Okay. I probably, one more. Okay, so it isn't like that idea to, maybe it is bad idea to set everything to like, just 3,000 barrels per hour, and then 100% of time, like you got something off and goes through. But that aren't you also like kind of inefficient, because you can have some buildup, like there can be cost saving buildup. Yeah, this is a really interesting like big philosophical question. So if we said it, here's the way I'd answer it in a couple of ways. Really quick. If dryers were like a million dollars apiece, we would need to think systematically about, where's the bottom I can, how much does it cost to fix the bottom? If we wanted to like, if we were really worried about capacity in the overall system, because market demand was 3,000, we might want to think about that and just say, everybody has to make 3,000, and we're going to look at where we're falling short. You have to take, we've been taking a very myopic view of the process here, and steward, if we were being, you know, next level on this, we want to step back and think like holistically about what are the costs and what is the market doing, what are these things all cost. And we might want to take that something to account. Today, we've been thinking quite simplistically. If we did another day, we might want to think about that big picture stuff, like you said, and think holistically. You guys are awesome today. Great job."
