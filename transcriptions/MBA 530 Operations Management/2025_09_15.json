  "text": "were there or people that are suffering, like keep your, keep aware of that stuff and somebody's really affected. I don't want to put on you to intervene but let another person up there and if you're really worried about somebody. I think it's been really surprising after the shooting, like how many folks I've known that I've just felt really bad and had affected by it and that's in some other way kind of, kind of just combined related and we should be part of a community that helps people that are doing that. So keep your area around the line. And in the spirit of both of you know being nice and the podium PC in there didn't work this morning, like a keyboard didn't work. So for section two I decided not to do our little attendance quiz that I was going to do so I'll just show you what that looked like. We was going to put this up on the board. Well we're not going to do that today. Can't you do a QR thing just like with the first day class? And I was going to ask you what was the, there's always a chance. Tell us what the two quiz questions were. They don't want to get credit. No, no, no, no, no. Last day first thing, let's question one. At what percentage or percentage standard performance type is art the marina of what we do work and which machine or resources the bottleneck and marinos are. Okay, so this is the nature of the quiz I'll probably do from very time to the fourth and the starts. This will go into it. Participation range. So we're not going to do this one today so I'm just going to start to type it. Don't go ahead. Caroline, can you just, Caroline, just get that? Yeah. Okay, don't go put like you know bad words in there. Just in Swedish.  Yeah. There were good questions. Oh thank you. I'm sorry. I heard that happen. That was such a good answer that you don't do it. It's not that bad. That's all I have to say.  That's all I have to say. Okay, so. For facts is a factory on the cover we get going back. So I want to just kind of accept the people here in terms of like our own process in the class. So pretty soon that is that we're going to talk about the company. I want this, I want this discussion today to be like low stress. It feels like I have low stress on you. You have a whole lot of stuff. But I want you to just like think about what it is that we're really trying to do. So we're going to talk about like a business challenge. Okay. This place has stuff that they're wrestling with. Like the big picture stuff. The pattern that we're going to normally do in classes understand the big picture. So I asked one to be able to talk what's one of the future. And then we're going to take a dive down into understanding the process that none of us have ever been involved with in reality. How many people have been in a machine shop? So some of you have been in the machine shop. But that's the school of you, the rest of you have been. We're going to spend a bunch of time trying to visualize how the process actually works here. And in service of the goal of trying to figure out how we can like yield with the business problem. So I don't want you to feel like if you were like, oh my gosh, how did you guys calculate that? We're going to try to go in a pace today where we're all trying to stay along, stay on the wagon here. To probably stretch ourselves and get some new tools, understand the process. So that by end we can come back up and altitude and say like, what's it this place? What's it, what's it, what's it we do? Like if I got a job here or doing consulting here, what should we do? So that's how we're trying to incorporate. How often do we spend multiple days on a case? The owner is going to basically be pretty much yet. Later in the semester we'll do a simulation where we'll also do a case on the hospital. I know that's like a lot of stuff. Would you like to spend more than one day on those cases for them? No, I was just curious because it's a different type of deep dive, right? The preparation for two different days where we get a little bit of context and then that changes how we need as a group. Totally, but yeah. Now I don't want to be funny about this, but you could do as many days as you want on this case. Sure. Okay. That was funnier to me than most of you. Okay. I think that's it. Ian. Ian. I thought you guys would get to go down here 100%. How did you know? You said it was a smarty. Did it really? It's been inspired to see you. Tell us about what's going on here in the picture. They picture fabric taxis as a relatively new type of order they've never done parts. They've got automated back to work. Yeah. It's season. What's the name of the customer? The customer? This is actually the maker I want to come in as I can see. The now the font disguises the limit. And then the height of the air quality. It's a trial order. The expectation is if they see, they'll probably get larger in the case of order, or they'll get larger in the case of the customer in the picture. They've had to have rear range, some of their equipment to accommodate the order to kind of process right there. And they've taken four workers for the previous jobs, some of which you have to end to. They need to make the order available to the number of 650 units per week delivered on Fridays. And we put it down to the actual one. What's the exact same thing divided by five? What is it? 130. This is like 130 per week ish. Perfect.  Perfect. Sorry. Thank you. Okay. And then the kind of average amount of their doing per day is 133. So there's about 15 unit bumper based off of this average. Okay. You know, it's a good one. But, what's going to say to you about this? So is it, we come from a concept of a job shop. What, like, records, like, tells how a better day fits into this concept of a job shop. My understanding is they have the equipment to do pretty much anything. Okay. And so a lot of their equipment is into specialized set up to do quite a bit of stuff. Cool. This is in fact like almost a definition of a job shop here in EIC, nail it. It's like, Joe, Purpose, Equipment, those of you, those of you who have been around a place like this, Jake, what kind of things took a place like this make? Literally anything. Literally anything. I mean, they kind of make stuff out of like, well, so it's primarily, they can make healthy bears. It's like, maybe steel based. Steel. But maybe aluminum and you know, a white shop did anything from, you know, hypersonic test chambers to mining equipment to, you know, defense parts. Nice. Were you the machinist? No. What does it take for something to be like, like, or really skilled machinist? Like, what kind of experience? It's like, how long does it take, you know, any idea what, like, the apprenticeship, you know, I think it's like five years? Five years, okay. So this is like the equivalent of a kind of a college degree kind of person. One thing I was surprised at when I started hanging around machine places is like, they do a lot of math. You know, like, you're always doing, you know, dividing stuff by two, like, adding stuff. You're going to sound like, you're going to be like, well, okay, so there's no calculus in the studio. But you're doing, like, these are, there's like a fair amount of math that folks are doing here. It takes some years to become a person like this. So this is like, this is highly skilled. Good machinist, how much can they make? Hmm. You know, 100,000. Yeah, here's a good, good, good, good, good. Yeah. I think one of the things that can make some of my things have a little one. It's a highly specialized piece that will work out any kind of thing. Here in TAN, there's a hot shot in TAN, and that's what keeping, you know, 10 to 12 hour days wasn't like that. Yeah, okay. That's cool. This is actually a good thing. Let's see. Haley. I'm not calling on you if you're talking to me a little later. I'm not calling on you if you're talking to me a little later. Being good at books, if you're not. Yes. Haley. Where's your H-type?  Okay.  What, tell us a little bit more like who works here. So we just take to say we've got some of these highly skilled, they've got lots of experience. Tell us about the like, the HR dimension of this piece. Yeah. The HR dimension, they have to manage kind of the incentives with the machines. They want to make sure that the workers don't have to wait for the machines to run. So they're trying to make sure that they have access to as many machines as they can so they can make more of what they're doing. Okay. Access to machines, what was the last thing to do? That was cool. Making sure they have the resources they need to make as much as they can. Make sure workers can work, workers can secure the bags. Okay. So who gets, who wants to, like, who wants to get hired at this place and just sticks around? What kind of work they're doing? The hard work you've got, but are you going to get more? They want to get more. And this is going to come up a little bit later, but our kind of incentive scheme here for people to tell us a little bit more about how we pay for people and how we give them incentives. Yeah, so they have to base pay and then the machine operators have the premium pay, but the quality inspectors are only paid out of the way. Yeah, base plus premium. I'm going to get a terrible headache. Premium, we haven't, this is for the workers. We've got some inspectors. Cool. And who's this guy that's going to end up being kind of our protagonist here? Where are you? What's your name? This is our machine, this is going to go four of these machines. Are you nervous? Arthur Moreno. Okay. When you envision like Arthur Moreno, what kind of like worker is he? He's definitely a hard worker. He's incentivized. Why did he stick around in this place? Because he was making a lot before he switched. How much was he making before? Six turns. Six turns. Yeah, and it comes up for percentage. What's his standard in bonus thing? Yeah, so for the base pay that we got, it was about $390, I think. And then in his old operation, he was making like 600 something. So he's making some percent of what he was making of the base before. Six, seven percent. Six, seven percent. So he's making 167 percent of the base he's making. He was making before. And then we move into this job and then what happened? He wasn't making quite as much. Why? Because, well, one of the things he wasn't able to get all of the materials needed from another worker. And this is causing, so this is cool. Thank big picture. We're trying to win this order. This is going to be like amazing if we can start selling to our company. Where a machine shop that can make anything from hypersonic wind chamber tunnels to car parts. What's the coolest thing you've ever seen made on a machine shop? Well, a light specific job. I also went outside. I saw a lot of cool stuff. There was a test chamber for satellites, but I thought it was really cool. Three, you know, like 30 feet tall massive vacuum door. Vacuum door for a test chamber? Yeah, because they need to test it in space. Okay, so you can make cool stuff in this place. And now Arthur's, he's used to, when I vision Arthur and vision, he's putting it in his air pods and just like crank it away, securing the bags, making 167% of standard. And we've now done one with him, really. We changed. We moved him, we put him into this life. Why do we have to move in there? Because they have this huge order. They need to move in there. Yeah, keep going. What happened to the team that we, do you remember this? Yeah, their star worker had a car accident. Star worker. Yeah, it was a worker. That's it. That's it. So he wasn't able to work anymore. So they had to shift employees internally. And any sense for like what's going on like socially here with like Arthur? He wasn't particularly pleased with the change because he couldn't produce as much. And he actually got his high premium pay. Why couldn't he produce as much? One incident once he wasn't able to get the materials he needed early on. But I don't know if that was right. And your idea there that we basically have this like, guarantee that if you work here, we're going to give you a whole bunch of machines to work on. And you can just like make bank. We've altered that calculus a little bit for him. Cool? Cool. Okay. Derek? I was just going to say they couldn't do it. They wouldn't let him pile up for the next guy to star. So he kind of had to wait for that guy to keep moving parts before he could. Super frustrating, Jim. Oh, I was going to say the same thing. It's like in the other job he, if one machine was, he could just jump there. He was right.  So he could produce as much as he wanted all the time. And now you're just like a racehorse. Yeah. He can run as fast as he wants. And now we're like, yeah, down. He was also alone.  He was alone. Kind of alone. Maybe. He doesn't eat lunch with the other guy. Yeah, he does eat lunch with the other guy. Exactly. He's just like this in your podcast. Just leave me be doing this thing. Okay. Now, that's our setup. We're going to try to do that big picture. Because we're going to try to take a deep dive into the operation here and understand or if they're like, what's going on. And in doing this, hopefully we can make a little bit of sense of stuff. So I want to start by having, hey, let's just keep going. Sorry, Hayley. I'll be right back. Good. Hey. That's great. We're right back. I think it's an exhibit. You want to get the little table? Yeah.  You got a table. Hayley. And there's what I want to do. What I want to do. This is machine one, machine two, machine three, machine four. And then we've got a couple of different times here. Let's watch through what those are. Yeah. So the first one, the milling cut number one. Or you can put the little cycle time. Well, yeah, we can do that. We can do total, yeah, cycle time here. Okay. So for milling cut number one, the total cycle time is 3.594. 3.594. And that's decomposed a little bit. We've got machine time, external time, and internal time. And let's just get what those are. Yeah. So the machine time for number one is 2.6. Okay. Then the total operator time is 1.139. Okay. The external time is 0.994 and internal time is 0.145. Okay. Now, just for those of us who haven't been in the machine job, it sounds like you've got a lot of experience here. What's external time or what's internal time? Yeah. So the external time is... So Arthur walks up to machine one. And what's external time? Yeah. So the external time is the operator time required for part four. Tats is the operator's not expected to or cannot perform during the machine time. Okay. So Arthur's going to walk up to the machine, clanging apart, do a whole bunch of stuff to it, and he's going to spend hell on doing that. Yeah. Yeah. You had what of that external time is? Yeah. Is 0.944? 0.944 bananas? Oh. This piece is... 0.944 minutes. Minutes. Minutes. Okay. So he's going to spend almost a full minute getting this machine all set up. We've been talking about the set of times. That's basically what this is. He's going to push start, and then how long does he have to hang out? Well, then what's going to happen? And then he'll have to do like the input time. I just did the internal time. Internal time is going to hang out. So push the start, hangs out the machine, do it internal time for hell on? 0.145 minutes. 0.145 minutes. So this is like, whatever 15% of the minute is. And then for when he pushes start to when the machine kind of completes its task, how long is that going to take? It'll be the external time plus the internal time. No, no, no. External time isn't when it's running at all. It's going to be the machine time. Oh, sorry. So it's going to run for 2.6 minutes. Okay, cool. And then Arthur's got... This is one of the things that we're going to be trying to do today. Is this spent some time like getting comfortable with picking a part of process and actually understanding, given that none of us have been in machines office for a few of you here? We're going to be trying to like build our muscles associated with like picking a part of process. So what I want to do, Hayley, is you're going to play kind of like overseer here. And who did our electr�play through solder mass classes, as you for? Okay, why don't we get Alex through Charmaine before you guys come up here? Yeah. Okay, let's... By the way, I'm going to pass around a tenancy in most days. We're just signing here. This will go over the class. Okay. I don't know if you know this, but Alex is also known as machine one. Machine two, machine two, machine two. Cool. Hayley, who would you like to be Arthur Morales? No, not them.  Please tell me directly. Two? Is anyone volunteering? I'll take it. Okay. Okay.       Three more. Here's what we're going to do. I mean, one... Machine one, two, three, and four... Arthur. Here, we're going to try to visualize what the process looks like during the day. These are, even though these things are, so take a guess. What are we... Damn it. Coming to the library. We're going to use these to stand in for raw castings. Okay. So the raw castings is a part of raw materials in the toy that we get. What's the previous step? For Arthur. The main step. Inspection is good. So they're going to go through there. These are the raw materials. And we're going to go through them on twist of... I hope you'll do well sleep about last night or for previous week. We're going to start the day for Arthur with part of each machine. This is called steady state operation. Probably Arthur had one day when this order was started. He had to get all the machine stocked up so we can get it to what he wants to. But what happens is at the end of the day, Arthur is just going to leave semi-finished parts on all of the machines. Is that cool?  Okay. Hey, are we... Arthur walks in to work... ...7 a.m. And he's going to now get working starting a machine one. So let's... We're going to control, tell Arthur what he's going to do. Uh... He's going to take whatever input he has and then follow the process for the machine one. Okay, so Evan, Ailey, figure it out. We're going to write these up on the whole thing. Ailey, don't do this. It's work. Where is he going? Ailey, where does he go? So I'll start with milk cut one. Milk cut one. Okay, so she won't go ahead. She's running for a million. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can't you do it? Resume machine ones right here. No, no. Okay, come on, Evan, come on. We can't wait. This is actually important. What's that? When that you start with four. No, we let... When you walk out on Friday, you let... You let the short main idle there. Yeah, with the... ...probably a finished part there. Yeah. But we're going to start... We're going to start it on the machine one. Okay, so slow mo. We're going to continue. He is softer inspection. You get two trails and then... Okay, go watch. He's going to pick up a rock. A rock casting from the previous step. He's got a block up. Here, stand over the side. So do what you're doing. Watch what he does. This one here, completed last night, or on Friday night. He's going to take it here, put it in a little buffer between steps. Right there. Load this one up. Okay, so load it up. Haley, how long is he going to have to spend loading this up? How long is he going to take? Pull out it up. I think it's 0.94. Banana? Okay, so he's going to load this machine up. It's going to take him... Almost a full minute to clamp this thing in there. Get it all ready to go. After 0.94 minutes, what does he do, Haley? Uh... He... Look, Haley. There's a power limit right there. I have more of a mid-sword, Haley. You're going to machine a lot to rush. Now, Alex, machine a lot to rush. Processing the part, and then he immediately gets you a machine too, right? No, I saw some head shake. What do you got to do? I saw you shake your head. What's he going to do? Stop on the machine. No, Lindsay, what's he going to do? He's going to make some adjustments for the machine. How long? About 0.145 minutes. So, he's going to stay with the machine one with Alex. Make sure that everything's running fine. Squirt the boil on there. 1.145 minutes. Brad has a question for you. Are we assuming or do we know all of the internal time? It's like at the beginning of the product. It goes, it's sequential, external time, internal time, machine time. I have a super dissatisfied answer for you. Not bad. It's actually not going to matter. I'm a super dissatisfied. I disagree. Oh, I agree. So, to respect that question, let me ask you why you asked. So, if, say like it's in the middle of the process, you know, like, okay, once the machine's going for a minute, then he needs to put some oil on it or put some water because it's heated up. There's our temperature. Now we need to cool it down, which is critical machine. You can use cool down some time. So, but now he's already in the middle of step two. Prepping the next machine, he has to interrupt himself, come back. Right? And if he's running all these four machines at once, which, based on the amount of his output, he's doing four things at once. It's going to get pretty complex. Okay. If I may, like, this is a really, really good question. And my first answer to this is, if you got your dream job consult to get an advertent, you can figure this out by going down to the shop going like looking at saying, yeah. You have to hit, like, cool it on this interspersed out through what, it's run or you can either all at once. Like, you can figure this out, right? Or you can hold that? Yeah. Yeah. My second dissatisfaction is it's not going to matter. But I'm going to just, just, believe me for just like 10 minutes, then we're going to come back and see why I'm cutting that. Okay. Okay. So, Yemen, completed how long? How long? Where you, where did you get to stick around with Alex? 1.5 minutes. Haley. Then watch, watch what he does. Now, this is, this is kind of just important. I understand visualizing the process. Remember, he left a straw right there between machine 1 and machine 2. Go ahead. Yemen, what are you going to do? Okay. So, he takes a load machine 2, which at the end of the buck, what are you going to do with that? Loads up machine 2. How long you, no way, how long you should have been doing it? How long you have to stick to getting that out there? 7.4. With 7.4.4 and machine 2. And then after point 7.4. I don't know. Me, my Alex is still on, and will for a while, he's going to just automatically stop after 2.6 whatever minutes. Okay. And then Haley, you can get out of here. Just let's it run. Okay. Then, what's he going to do? We'll talk about that. Okay. A load. A load. How long you spend there? Haley, how long you spend it? 28. 28. 28.  One minutes. Okay. Set it up. And then, how long you stick around there? 23. 23. 23 minutes. I'm hoping to make sure that machine 3 is running well. Okay. Okay. Now. Oh. Drop that on the floor. Watch. Listen. Kirt jump. Kirt jump. Okay. Load up. Now. Now, what's, what's Haley going to do? After finishing the running? Meanwhile, Alex probably has finished running. Okay. Like, we'll do the math in a minute. Alex has finished running. What's Haley going to do? Go back to the machine. The math machine won. Okay. Unload. Load a new one. Okay. Now, go in fast motion. And control. What are you going to do all day? Okay. This is like, he just do a lap to the machine 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Brad still has a little worm in his brain saying, the internal time, but could he like move that around? It's okay. We're going to get to that in a bit. Any questions for Amin? The nature of Arthur's day is just showing 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. And periodically, Sharmin is making what's down? We're shining. Kirt jump. Awesome. Okay. Are we cool with this? Okay. Great job everyone. We're going to, we're going to, that's my notion. We're going to follow these the cats. We're going to try to scan this cat in the front leg. Do you have any expression in the front leg? There are many ways to scan a cat. No. That's okay. We should have that. What will be the, is there any expression in some other language? It's very, very magic. What are they, how long will they stay in Sweden? Let's try to find out. Should we be able to have it? Okay. Let's try to find out. That's not right. That's not right.  What's that? What are you saying, Jenny? No, I was just saying, I was playing with a phrase, man. Like, there's a different way to do the same thing. Yeah. That's more than you may. Exactly. I think that's not the same, like, different strokes. That's kind of cool. It's different. There are different ways for us to analyze the process. And we're going to do a couple of different ways. And again, the goal here is to help us all those who are minute machine chops do some like visualization. Again, we're not doing this just to like mess around. We're doing this in service of understanding the business challenge so that we can hopefully come back right end and figure out what this place ought to be doing better. Cool? Okay. So, what we're going to draw here is something you probably may have been done in your, you know, playing for a party or maybe you've done this in your job. Zach. Well, I'm not picking on you just because you're making some many comments about what you've done since then. You're so good.  Uh, we're going to draw again. I can't chart. I can't chart. It's like something you've all probably intuitively done or we're going to try to be a little bit formal and rigorous about it. And on the x-axis, we're going to do time in this case in minutes. And we're going to basically try to like do a bar graph of how this stuff works. Corbin. This thing, how it comes to us, the places for starting to do in Gantarks, there's like two industries that we're really doing this. Uh, one was a not surprising, but an example engineering. So if you're building like, you know, the Golden Gate Bridge, you've got to like, you know, forge the iron, uh, burrs, you've got to, in parallel, probably you're making some rivets and then you're delivering them to the job site and then you're going to be like, you have this like production plan that you do in bars. And then they also did this like really really early user of this kind of thing with the movie industry. To think about like, uh, you know, Brad Bitts, here has to be short for these scenes and then he's going to have longer hair, oh, we haven't been longer here before we do the shorter hair scenes. So I'm going to like, you know, then we're going to cut this hair and then do the other scenes and then there's like a scene or like whatever. And you could probably, what's AUNA to be? That's literally like AUNA is your star, the unit is like shooting scenery. Yeah, so you could probably be doing those scenes in parallel. Right? So, so, but ideally what you like to do is compress this down, so that you can get this through the release time for this work. Cool? So that's what we're going to try to like plot this out. What this looks like in the background. Is Gantz an acronym? No, it's an, it's a dude. That's not helpful. But you can come over there. Two out of the discussion, you just come over there. Okay, are we going to go over this? So Zach, we're going to start it like 7 a.m. or time zero. And we're going to find a Gantz chart when we do it the right way on the red axis where we've got to less resources.    Or processes, but we're not, we're not going to less like individual straws here. We'll later on we'll figure out how to map the journey of an individual casting or a straw. Right now this is going to be, sounds a little bit weird. This is going to be a picture of the journey of these machines over the course of the day. So, Zach, machine one, what happened? There's some set of time going on. And how long does that so, time left? One, nine, four minutes. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, point nine nine four minutes, point nine nine four, and that's external time. Cool? Then what happens? There's the internal time. Okay, we said one such machine time. Yeah. And what did Amman do at point nine nine four minutes in? Start with our two stars. Yeah, start with the machine. Push start and then how long is the machine going to run for? Two point six minutes. Okay, there. Okay. So that's going to be two point six minutes of machine time. Are we close up our? Okay, of that, it's right a little bit like hung up on this, but it's okay, right. Of that two point six minutes, how long is Arthur going to spend like hanging out the machine for you to sit actually? One point four five minutes. Okay, so he's going to do point one four five minutes here. This is the internal time, the part of the two point six minutes of machine time. Now, Amman, look, we got Brad, but Brad's insight here that he's, because he spent a bunch of time the last couple of nights worrying about this is it might be the case that that internal time doesn't have to be piled up there right at the beginning of this. Maybe it could be interspersed throughout or maybe it should be, but for right now we're just going to assume that it happens at the beginning. That's that's kind of the substance of Brad's point, right Brad? Yeah. I don't want to, I don't want to miscare for it. Well, my main concern of this is pushing all to the front for efficiency, but he should be doing it in the middle and it's affecting our quality. Being a bad guy. Yeah, you know, just like, yeah, like you're on a machine, you're in the middle like, oh, I'm almost going to say, oh, that's smoking, I need to put some water on it. Let me just finish this real quick, you know, then okay, now I got like my finishes and it's good, my service is bad. Yeah, yeah. What is cool? Who's our TV and being here? We're all about playing a retribution here. So we'd like to figure out if he might be, if our good being a bad person, and Brad's worried about that absolutely. And then he's incentivized to keep going. You could, he, he, the Nazi prison guard defense. Oh, she's cheating. She's cheating to do it. Sorry, that's a terrible way to do it. Can you hurt your jacket when by looking back at you? No, I'm not. Okay. Back to Zack. Zack, at what point does Arthur move to machine two? Back to that point, one, four, five, and then sit in. Two, three, four. So Zack says right here is where Arthur goes over and how long he's going to spend getting set up there? One, seven, four, four minutes. Point seven, four, four minutes. That's our external time. And he pushes start and it's going to run for two point, two two minutes. Two point, two two, two two. This is machine time of which, how much is internal time? Point two, four eight. Point two, four eight. Okay, we're getting a picture here of Arthur's day. We're basically graphically representing what alien ammon helps us with. Cool? Zack? Then, then one is Arthur going to machine three. After that point, two, four eight. Right here, okay? Yep. And then he's going to go, how much internal time, or external time there? Point eight, one minutes. Okay, one, external time. Okay? Pushed start and it's going to run for two point, four two minutes. Okay? Point four two. Okay? Of which? Three, or sorry, point three, six, three minutes or internal time. Point three, six, three is internal time. Okay? Stick with us everybody. This is a little boring, but this is cool. Okay? Then what? And then after that point, internal time is going to start the external time, which is one six, so seven minutes. Point six, so seven, okay? And then finishing runs for one point, one, one, eight minutes. And I'm going to actually draw, if I work this out before, Charmaine is actually going to finish before Carlos does, but that's cool, it's not that big video. Of which, they're going to run for one point, one, one, eight minutes. And then of that point, four two eight is internal time. Internal time. Are we going so far? Yes, Ian. So, I have a question. Okay. The reading says that the four million machines are set up to allow the automatic speed, three, twenty, twenty, and next. Yes. That is what goes like what's happening. Is this the same from one to the next? Yes. It just says that it allows the automatic speed apart to those options with fuel, operator to run all engines. Okay. So, this is like not, just a little bit inside or info. Jake, what does automatic speed apart mean in the machine? One in this case, it's just meaning that the building process is going to do its own thing. You don't have to have to operate your manually. Alex has automatic speed inside of Alex. Not from machine one machine. Not exactly exactly.  Cool. Ah, crap. Throw it out of your analysis. That's my interpretation. Okay. That's what we're going to do. That's what you're going to do. Exactly. Did you guys argue that one for a while? A little. A little bit. Alex, let's just say that's why we go to the shop and actually go on one. Be still in the car. Is that? Now, what does Arthur do after he gets machine or started? Arthur's here, set up for 0.607. Push your start, sticks around for 0.4 to 8 minutes, and then what does he do? He starts over at any moment. She has an aminus here with machine 4, runs back, and gets machine 1 started again. So at this point, that's where Arthur's going to go. And let's just draw out the rhythm of Arthur's day here. Okay. I'm going to be a little condantic here and drop the light these things in really fast. Just to help us see. Point on to 4.5, 2.6, 7.4. I'm going to do anything wrong here. I'm going to get this wrong. We've got 8.1, 2.3, 6.3, 2.2, and 2.6. I'm going to put the numbers in. Let's see if there's any left. Okay. Are we cool so far? This is a picture of Arthur's day. So Zach, let me start, let me ask you a question. Here's a question for all of you. Don't muddle after anything loud or quiet. What's the bottleneck here? Which machine is the bottleneck? Zach? Which? M1. Why do you say M1? It's a long time cycle. Okay. The total cycle time here is the sum of machine type and external type. This plus this equals this in Jordan. Zach says the bottleneck step is machine 1. Alex builds a little defensive because he was in fact machine 1. You're not the bottleneck in anything. Sorry, I have a question. Sorry. Okay. We're not machine 4. You're trying to shift like this, right? Why do you say Schrodinger is good at developing? Because it's the longest time he has to sit with 1 bullet for any. Before he can move. How many more need he has a machine? More. So I put the point for it to... To 1 plus character. It's kind of very long, but it is slightly wider before he goes back. I like this. This is really exciting. Let me ask. Looking at this, what's the bottleneck? Right? Is it mouth 4 because there's such a big gap between when they can start up again? Oh, I like that. That's cool. Other ideas. Monty. Isn't the bottleneck the worker? Yeah. Who is the worker? Arthur. What do you mean? Well, we're limited by how much E.K. moves from one machine to another. The whole thing is that our average cycle line comes out to... We can output 440... I'm sorry, 100 units. Which results in 440 1 minutes of work. Which is corresponding to the operator's time. Is that? Well, I'm just going to say that the external time... Even for the internal time too, I think M1 is still the longest. Right? For the operator. The operator's time. That's the bottleneck. I'm going to run it. Let's do this with us. Monty. Let's do... Let's put Arthur here. Not just he humanize him. He'll resource here.  What's that... Let's draw out Arthur's day. He's a resource in the factory. What is his day or what? Sir, it's a machine line. Machine line. It was the machine too. Oh, a line. So that's internal and external. Yeah. Then he's going to go to machine. So this is... He's at machine 1. Here's going to go to machine 2. Okay? It's a machine 3. It goes to machine 3. Machine 3 is right here, external. Okay? And the machine 4. Okay? And then we're at the actual machine 1. And then he's going to go back up to machine 1. What do we see here? What do you see in this... In this depiction of Arthur's day. He's seeing what he thinks is working constantly. Okay. This is a great way to see the Arthur... Zack. Do you care, Rosa? Revise your answer. What's the bottle like here? It's Arthur. Why do you say that? Because he's the one that the machines depend on. It's like it going... He's taking all the time essentially. If machines... This is creepy. If machines were going to get on Tinder. Yeah. There'd be a lot of time. They're out there. Where do you see that? I don't know exactly. Um... Like machine 1. When does machine 1 get to be on Tinder? For everything after that 2.69. Right there. Machine 1 is not fully utilized. There's like air bubbles in the gantler between what machine... So machine 1 and machine 2.3 are all going to have like down time during the day. Now, actually, you see this? Regardless of whether it's sharpening in the whole bunch of internal time. She's got a bunch of time to sit around and rest. Before the next cycle starts. The only resource, the only machine here that doesn't have time to rest... Monty is one... It's Arthur. Okay. In fact, if we were to do Arthur right here and do this mathematically... We have something like... 3.226... 1.144... That's Arthur has a lot of... He's fully utilized here. Does that mean that that's random? Okay. Brad. This isn't what you were asking before. But it's adjacent to it. Part of the reason it kind of doesn't matter here is that internal time is not... That's not our challenge. No matter where we move internal time around here... We can't come up with a really clever... Like... For Arthur to be involved in here... Then, like... He gets him less than... He's just working 100% of time. Cool? Yeah. As we're drawing here. In fact, okay. Now, this is... Zack? Let's do some calculation here. At what point does... Sherman machine four... Make the first person... I think it's 11 point. Oh, not your pole. Oh, right after step four. Right here is going to probably... Now, it could be when Arthur comes up in... ...whatever, whatever. Okay? So, someone calculate... Adam for us what that point is on the graph. James, did you do it by 017? Uh, did I have it? Hold on. I have 5.1. Is that not the end of the decimal? Okay. I'm going to... Just take my big... I think the next five will be the last one. Okay. Now, uh... When is the next trick to happen? Somebody add it from... What is the next? The next trick to happen is how things are here. Okay, what time is that? How long does it take to get that far? It will be 10 to the right to do it on this. But I have a point to start on. No, no. No. No. Because this is not... Well, you're on the last case. 5.1 minus 4. Uh, I've got... It's going to be at 9.5. Cool. This is not... Okay, this is not like a calculus. This is use it now to calculate or... And making sure that you're careful not to... Uh, give credit for internal time, whatever. But you're just going to add up the numbers here. Cool. Uh, okay. Given the way we've drawn this... How far apart are these two perchungs? 4.1 minus 4.  4.8. 4.1 minus. Okay, so, Dalin says... Those two perchungs are 4.41 minutes. Again, I have to minimize your contribution here. There was no algebraic involved here, no calculus. It was literally just figuring out... Like, 9.5.1 minus 5.1. Okay, cool. That's how far apart those two things are. We have to care and have some of gas. Uh, as to how long it's going to be until the next one. 4.1.4.1. Okay, now, I'm going to ask... I'm feeling most scared right now. I'm not really sure. Lindsey, you looked kind of scared. Lindsey. Yeah. What's the second one? Um... For what? What is the... What is the 10 between perchungs? 4.41. 4.41 bananas? Minus. Minus. Okay, now here's what I want to ask Lindsey. This one's for all the marbles. So we've said that those two points on the graph are... 4.41 minutes apart. Are we cool? Lindsey, uh, if we said that perchungs really happens when Arthur walks up to the machine and to, like, load it up. How far apart are those two points? On the graph. From there to there. Um... Right there, I guess. You don't even need to calculate. Look at this. 4.41 minutes. Let's go with it. Okay. Uh, Lindsey, how far apart is that point and that point? Also, 4.41 minutes. Okay. I'm going to say something that's going to resonate with, like, 20% of you that really had a fun time in high school physics class. This is kind of like measuring wavelength. Where you're measuring from, like, peak to peak or drop to drop or whatever. If that didn't work for you, don't feel bad at all. We're basically saying from perchung to perchung. Is hella lonely, Lindsey? 4.41 minutes. And from, you know, larger loading to Arthur loading is 4.41 minutes. Any place along here on the gap, where we go from left to right, is going to be 4.41 minutes apart. As we draw it here, Zach, where do we get these numbers from? Just from the table. From the table. And those represent what, like, the standard rate. What does standard rate mean? 100 pieces a day. This is like, yeah. And this is like, some industrial engineer looked at this, you know, stopwatched this for a while and then said, you know, for the weakest of the people here, we could done this down. And pretty much anybody should be able to do 100 per day. Jen, that's the base. And you're going to work faster than that one. Well, one is going to be a table. We get a table. Cool. Are we good with this? So this is a depiction of production at standard. Zach, we have a cycle time, Lindsey says, 4.41 minutes. Every 4.41 minutes we hear perchung, perchung, watch. 4.41, perchung. Obviously in the real world, that's an average. It's not going to be precise enough, but that's what happened. Jay. Question. So assuming in a different scenario, if the operator was within our bottleneck, with a portraying time, then we'd be working maybe at the internal process with the BD. Maybe. A. 0.8.5.4. I'm here. Maybe we're in. In fact, we're in there just a second. Zach, how many minutes per day are we working? Look, here's one. Here's one. We're going to have a second to pick up. If we're working at standard, how many of these castings can we process through our first set? How many can Arthur prove per day? Arthur. Arthur. 167. No. It's standard. Oh, it's standard. How did you figure that out? Hold up. So I did. Okay. 60. Hold up. 8 hours per day. Times 60 minutes per hour. It gives us 4.80 minutes per day. And Zach, what's going to happen? 39.         39. Minutes. A break. And then, that gives us 4.31.  40. 40. 40.   40. 40. 40. 40. 40. That's almost like two to the truth. Why did they end up the numbers? This is minutes per day. Work. And we can take that 4.41 over 4.41. So, 441 minutes per day. Divide it by 4.41 minutes per unit. It's going to give us 100 units per day. Why did the numbers work out so perfectly there? It's not as good. Because it's not as good.  The person writing the case wanting to be really perfect. Yeah. I mean, that's just standard. That's like super efficient just being perfect. This is like, we've said, we've said basically almost like the industrial engineers are constructed this so that people can make a hundred percent. John, where is it? I was going to say this is a design of the first product. It's going to be like a plate of the dollar. Probably not for this particular order because that's probably something that's governed by, you know, this union around giving you. So, it's probably got like three, three diamonds to be something governed by the unit. Union contract. Or by a company called C. There's a case you have a man of the room. Oh, Jared. Oh, I did raise my hand. Oh, that does make it a bad system. Don't go into an auction. No, okay. I've had worse problems in my life. That means it's a bad system though, right? If you're having 100 percent of the time already to make it actually a hundred, then, yeah, then incentivize it or because like the pseudo standard almost is 133. And then Arthur's putting himself even further beyond that. So, 167. So, 167. Okay. Do we all see Arthur can make that standard? He can make 100 per day. The case tells us he's actually making 167. Why Jared is he doing that? Almost incriminately fast. Why is he doing that? He's not getting paid for that. What does it know? So, he was making, he's working as hard as he needs to to make the same salary that he was making in his prior position. Okay. You see this? We have this dude who's highly motivated. He's really good. We said, hey, we have a little accident. This is the support of the company. We're going to put you into this job. Arthur says, cool. I'm cool doing that, but I want to make a statement. I want to say, why is he a greedy bad person? This is the guy from his own family. You whatever. Yeah, what kind of name is he?  Oh. I don't know. I don't know. I got it. No, he says he has a big name. No, no, no, no, no. He says he has a boat name. He just bought a... Oh, what? Where did it go? It's... He doesn't really see it. He doesn't really see it. He's like, hey, you're on it. He's got a boat name in it. He's got a boat name in it. He's got his college, kids college, tuition payment. He's got something going on. He's trying to get back to whatever he was able to earn before. Okay, so he's the bottleneck. We've money included. What would it mean like someone... Is this clear to somebody, what would this Gantt chart need to look like? Can it work for Arthur to produce 167th per day? Alex? Yeah, it's the next journal. I would have to shrink this the other day. It's pretty standard. It's a whole thing. Yeah, oh, that's good. Yeah, yeah. So, Alex says we could squeeze these things together. You can't squeeze. You can't squeeze... He's got a big name. These machine types, because those are like dictated by the names of the machine tool. Right? So, maybe Arthur's just going to like super speed. He's squeezing down these machine types. Cool. Let's just really quickly figure out... Alex, what's the applied cycle time that Arthur is running at? And he's making 167th per day. Okay, let's... We just... We just... Here, Alex is going to do some math for us. So he's going to take the time you get back with him. Yeah, or the day, times and seasons. Okay, so that's 480. Yeah, minus 39. Okay, minus 39, that's going to be 4-1, minutes per day. In which to work. And then Arthur can do what during the time? It's saying that he actually, in a reallnant produces 167th. The applied cycle time implies... Cycle time is what? 2.64 minutes. 2.64 minutes. Okay, now, everybody... Think about what this says. If he's going as fast as we think he is. Every 2.64 minutes per jump. Per jump. Per jump. Per jump.  Per jump. Look over here at this chart. Look up here. What does this apply to you? He's doing it. Joseph, what do you see? It looks like he's almost caught up to the machine one at the bottom. He's compressed the whole thing down so that basically machine one is the bottleneck. How much time does that give him to do all of this external time? What? Sorry. 4.04. How much? Lindsay says? Like 2.2 minutes. Yeah, 0.0 to minutes. 0.04 minutes. How much is 0.04 times 60? Somebody wrote? 2.4 minutes. So this says that he's doing... It implies that he's... If this is really what he's doing, he's getting all of his external time done for all four machines. Ammon. Where's Ammon? Right here. Ammon. I'm quick. This is like flash. Yeah. He's shortening the machine. So what he had multiple minutes to do this, whatever the sum of machine times are. I don't know. Sorry. Whatever the sum of external time was. 3.2 minutes to do all of his work. Now, Lindsay and Ammon say, he actually had... No, 2.5 seconds. So between all four machines, he's going, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. He's only putting in 2.5 seconds of work. Total. Total. Dallin says, this stretches credulity. So what's going to... What else can I give you? What did that be? 2.5 seconds for the first one, because then during that 2.6 minutes, that's the first one running. He can still... He can do some internal time. External, internal. Okay, so now we're starting to form some hypotheses that are going to start to get us to maybe our business problem, which is maybe... And this is kind of what Brad's head was a little bit earlier. Maybe he's doing some like clever stuff. Maybe it's illegal. Reallocating internal time and external time with stuff. Jared? Could you be using the machines more efficiently and they're first changing the machines? Okay, a super optimistic view of what Arthur might be doing. What would you do to use it? So he's smart. We said it takes him like five years to become this. He's employable elsewhere. We've given him this impossible task with these standards. Jared says maybe he's doing what? Making the machines go faster. How? Okay, so he decided to dial up the feed rate on this machine. I can get to 11. I'm trying to get to 11. If you looked at the picture up there, Jared, which of those machines would you crank up to work faster? I would use one. Machine, why? Because it's the bottom line. It's your next candidate bottleneck. If you were cranking that one up really fast, is that? What happens when you increase the feed rate potentially here? I mean there's a lot of issues. You get more skipping. You get a tool chatter. Okay, you get something going on. Jared says that maybe that's okay. Why? I didn't say it was okay. But also he's not having issues right now. Okay, well, he's not having issues. Maybe, does anybody decide what to do that's coming after them? For Jane, that's like mad at him? Yeah. Yeah. What does that mean? Okay, so, this is one. Arthur's a super smart guy. What he's doing is speeding up. You're speed rate from machine one. It may cause a little bit of a rougher cut. But that's cool because you can slow down, charmein, because charmein at tons of time, and maybe you can slow down some of the other cuts and get the finish to work out right. So, main archer is like modeling for you. He's trying to balance the line here by speeding up the bottleneck machines and slowing down some of them at plenty of time. What's the, then do you have a debut of Arthur? Yeah, well, the guy that comes after him says he's getting a crap like the Stagen-Walver and the East and the West and the West. So, a bad cyclone analysis of Arthur would say, what's he actually doing here? Why would he be messing up stuff? He wants to get through fast and... Why? Oh, you did do it. The incentive was just on out, but not on the good out. Making garbage. Is there even a deeper asset aggressive explanation for what he wants to do? He wants to get him back on a little job. He's sabotaging the whole business. I like how cynical it is. Maybe he's sabotaging the work as he hates working with these guys double-click one more time on the HR thing. What else could he do on here? I mean, he's running his machines harder, maybe the vids are getting worn out, and that's why the quality is suffering. The first week when he speeds it up, there's no quality issues. So maybe he's kind of clever, but he's not clever enough that it's like the toolware of his housing problems. You might be running a backup company by screwing over the work. Oh, I like it. My case works are sucks. I don't get paid in jail for paid. The team that he's got to turn it into... Do those guys have the incentive to screw with Arthur? He's trying to make more money than that. He's trying to make more money than that? And he doesn't like working with that. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I was going to ask, is there any Jane concerned that somebody coming in and redefining or resetting a standard for a process could affect what everybody else is expected to do later on? Okay, so I'm Chase. Yeah. Great. Yes, that's my answer. So what? So I feel like that could be some conflict with the other guys. Especially if they're seeing some quality issues. Like if this is going to be the standard, we're not going to set... What's the problem, Chase? It's going to... No, no, no. What's the problem? Yeah, okay. They're not set up to be able to handle the order for this. No problem. Why? Because they... Well, I mean, the real... It seemed like they didn't have as many issues before their star had gotten heart-crash. Okay. But it feels like they're not able to keep up with the size of the order and what they need to get done. Who had their hand over? Joe, look. Yeah, the instructors can see the number. They're on the incentivize on speed and that's quality. And I'm also... That wasn't a problem before. Yeah, I'm wondering if maybe they don't like him. Maybe he's not the problem. Maybe he's the guy after. He's just... All we know is his word. They're liking a biker getting on each other. And then they put this Hispanic guy in the middle of their white biker band team. Like, racing like maybe they're jealous. They're so money. So they're like trying to... He's got all the way. Yeah. Yeah. Oh! It's getting real. Jacob, what's the problem? The infrastructure originally was when the operator was the bottleneck and now the machines are the bottleneck. There's not enough time for the one operator to turn all those machines. Wait. Hey Lee. Who said that right there with the star? Sorry. Having a relax at the machine. Why did we run our operation that way before? To incentivize them to crank out the... We built this whole structure at this place around smart machinists who could solve problems and we said, run as fast as you want, we're not going to constrain you. What have we done? Joseph? Constraint. Why? It has to fit this specific job. Who's fault is this? This is, I guess we're going to pick this job with the... What did Perfek's do it? Why is Stuart doing this? What did you do? Aaron? To incentivize him to apply more output and more sales. But nobody really does that in real life, do they? Everybody does that in real life. Why? More money, more older, more revenue, more share and more. What's more you're in? Stuart's trying to grow the business. It can't remind me of the case we did. It was a long way back from the beginning of the semester. What was it in the circuit board place? What was that one called? Don't know what we're going to do. Donner. Corbin, then we wanted to do two sessions of it. It's actually some pretty similar kind of patterns here. What's the problem here? I think you don't have enough machines to go around if I remember right now. Why? For this order? For this order. Why? For this order. There are already that capacity if I remember right or have volume. They just don't have enough. Yeah. Down. Business strategy and operation. Those are big words. What do you mean? Business strategy, meaning what kind of clients we're pursuing. Who were we pursuing before? We were, it was a smaller problem. We're making doors for hypersonic test tunnel for satellites that could hold the vacuum. Now we're making it bigger. No, 17,000. 17,000, a bunch of them, low, what, I can't ask you, Jake, how much does doors cost? I'm trying to remember the quote on that, boomer. I think it's probably 100,000. 100,000 bucks. And what we're not going to ask you to margins, how many of those doors, you've probably made a bunch of those doors, all right? No, just one. You don't need a whole bunch of satellite test chambers. Okay, so we went from a super high margin low volume business. Down, we're making 17,000 parts. What do you suppose the margin is on these little parts? It's low. We're trying to, we've asked this job shop to become a what, down. Factory, assembly. Factory. This feels a lot like the donor thing. Okay, so Brad, you know, pay respect to your thing for. This wasn't a challenge before because we had a smart person that were letting think on their feet, doing all their internal time and external time, they've grown up, you can manage a machine and not run into the ground. We've taken that person, we put him into a little group of people that he's working with. Did any HR person here get a little bit triggered at the idea of we're taking somebody who's almost like a Alex? This is almost like a sales person, right? Ewa, you kill, make as much as you want, go secure the bags. As long as you're not getting a bunch of charge bags, you're totally fine. Just go after it. Have you ever seen anything like this where you take a sales person and you put them like in a team? Yeah, I actually worked for a company where the sales team was selling very well and there was a payroll for me and a pageant. I'm just throwing it all down like, where the sales are selling that crazy, but the payroll team couldn't actually run payrolls that they were way understaffed and they couldn't handle the amount of payrolls that they need to be done and be needing to be every month. So I had several times where I sold, well, in September, October 1st, half of my people can't have these deals I just sold couldn't run payrolls so they all cancel because they need to figure out how to pay the people. You're being constrained by other parts of the operation. Uncapped commissions, but it wasn't uncapped because the rest of the idea was good to go faster. Yeah, yeah, oh, this is amazing. Now, I want you to see that we have basically a really difficult challenge and the easy and being answered the wrong answer. Here are the two possibilities. We should go back to what we were before and be a job shop where we can make $100,000 one-offs at high margin low-balling. Or we can grow the business, as Aaron says, and go sell big orders to car companies or Costco or whoever else is going to give us high volume and we can do that and become a factory. Right? And just like in the other, we can make these two operating models and that's causing us problems. We took somebody from this regime, Arthur, and we forced him to work in this regime and that's not working for him. And we can do the Wimby MBA answer, which is to, like let's just choose the middle ground and do both, which is exactly what they're doing. And by, you know, Mr. Miyagi from a karate kid, you walk in the right side of the road, you're okay, if you want to go less in the road, you're okay. You're already a little bad. We actually have a problem here because if you go to your showroom and say, we'd like to go back to being really small. That's like your fire is CEO. If we say, sorry Arthur, dude, we're going to work in a factory now. I know that you've been spent five years becoming a dirty man in China and you have these big, big, big, big payments. But we're going to make you a regular factory worker. Jared, what did he do? Goods. So our HR problem is we're going to start losing those people that are really skilled. We have to choose which one of those things we're going to be. And if we're going to try to do the hybrid model, we have to really clever about it because it's generally speaking not a half of safety. Next time, what are we doing? We're moving from machine parts to socks and children's sweaters. That's so awesome. You guys did a great job today. Thank you very much."
