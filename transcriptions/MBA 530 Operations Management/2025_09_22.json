  "text": "There we go. So, our belt in the case doesn't quite go back, but it does move along. And, um, I want to start by... Hey, did I already call by you before? No. You did? I can go again. Oh, did you? You did, you just want to say a little bit more. Say a little bit more. Here, remember, there are press bills, like, there are no direct stats, or, what was the worst thing? D5. Like, if you're trying to sample, you might, let's say, like, a little, uh, a little, a little, a little, um, right. You got two different dollars, and you got two different dollars. You take one out, because, like, your first sample, and then, sampling with replacement case once you know the benefit of, and, so, when you're sampling, it's impossible to take back out of it. What does that have to do with what it does have to do? She was back in the sample. She was back in the bowl, so just because you got cold cold, one time, especially, doesn't mean, like, that's it for you. I think it even happened twice in one single class. Right. That's right. Right. Right. Right. Haley. Yep. Um, so, some case describes, uh, this, uh, Tashiba back to the, uh, of the bare belt. And this is kind of a conceptual question. But, how is this, as you've seen this, uh, this process described here, how is this different from, oh, what was the case where we did the, um, this, uh, the source? Uh, the donor? Yeah. By the way, my test aren't gonna be like, requiring your remember the names of the cases, so that's like, I just, this might, have to might have a professor way to get you to like, you're back to the library. And then, what was the one with the machine set, with our RAM? I don't know, what was it? Faber-check. Okay. How, how is this factory different, than this, like, operation set, so that we're from the set up that we had, at, at, fabric, at $10. Yeah. So this one was, uh, a little bit of a combo of both, in the sense that they have the assembly ones, but, for a hybrid factory, they also have, like, the smaller cells as well, of like, a single operator and then a four operator cell. Uh, it's, uh, and assembly, okay? Cool. And, say what you said again about like, the cell, the cell, the work. Uh, they also have a single operator cell, and a four operator cell, in addition to their, like, standard assembly line. What do they use those for? The cell, the work, processors. And, uh, the assembly lines are for the, uh, the notebooks. Oh, so in that respect, it's a little bit like, a job shop, with those other places, or, like, this low volume stuff. Yeah? How, how else is it different? It's, uh, it won't be there. Like, what do you think? Just like, big picture, like, what do you think? I thought they're keeping it again. Think about the LEGO case and music for the case. The, for the first day of the new, with those cars. How was, how was it, how was it to shoot a different from, when we made those, who was your factory, who needed those LEGO cars the first day? Who was in your factory? Those guys were, how, how was it, how's it feel, they look different from that? Well, in some cases, there's one step where they're loading the software, where they're staggering the units, where they could do three at a time, if I remember correctly, like, the LEGOs, it was only one at a time. That's interesting. Uh, uh, John, since you said Fabritek, how's that, how did, what, um, I think you're getting ahead to station nine, where there's some, like, software loading that doesn't require a person. Does that remind you of anything that happened at Fabritek? What were the scratch? What were the ops and what were the serial? It was serial, yeah. Any of the thoughts on, like, how that's a little bit like Fabritek? This kind of is the shop of art. He's simply letting us move against other kind of other spaces really working properly. Okay, that's cool. That's cool. Um, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good. Well, this is, the cases are kind of starting to blend together, my head a little bit, but this is where Arthur Marino would start the machine, and then he would run to the next machine and let it kind of do his thing. It could, like, do its things. So sometimes the machines were, do you do that? Sometimes the machines were like running, even without the operating rate there. Station nine's going to feel like that one week, right? I'm a little bit afraid of station nine, but we're probably going to get to it sometimes. Okay. Uh, what else is there? So, so how is this all sort of like, how, compare this thing to the back to the leg of the leg? That's not like us. Yeah. How do they just, how do they decide that group up there? How do they decide the pace of, uh, of constructing a leg of the body? Yeah. When we're doing it, if there are groups we try to communicate like one one person was done, because they could pass it. And then in this case, um, they had like the belt turning, and then they would use types of signals that might be getting ahead, but they would use signals to indicate when they were switching models. So that's the general communication. That's cool. Cool. I like that. Any other thoughts on that? I'm not going to give it a question. Yeah, Paige? Isn't it based on the longest cycle time of the initial? Yeah. So how does the pace of this conveyor belt, like it, is a video with Lucy and Ethel, it was like a mean boss that was setting that too fast. How did the pace of the conveyor belt get sent here? Isn't it just when the, like what do you think? I don't actually go. Yeah, I mean, I would assume that it's just the longest, both the, the station that takes the longest time once that's finished, it moves on. Paige, if I put you in charge of setting the pace, like there's a switch over here, you can see it from the back of the podium here. That is like a little valve switch that controls the pace of that conveyor. How do you decide, you're in charge of this and you're watching stations one through ten. How do you decide how to pace that conveyor? I feel like I'm looking at who finishes last. And? And put it at that time. Okay. Just the dial, so whatever time you're in. Are you able to do it with this? Yeah, I would say also like looking for idle time. Oh, nice. I don't know. Sit down. You're cool. So I think it's going to last up and down the line. See how Paige's voice center head here, but a little, this one does have kind of mean. And she's going to set the pace of the line, then basically like look for the first person that runs out of ten or time. And as soon as that person gets to like full utilization, then that's where you set the pace of that. Is that cool? That's good. Okay. We're here. Yeah, I think I would base it off of the, again, like here's the lowest station. So, they gave us the bottle. Which ones are bottle like here? These both. Not good. Let's take out station nine from here. That's so complicated. I was looking for station two. Why do you say that? Because that kind of a little bit. It's up there. Okay. Yeah, it's out of your portion. Okay. So, Paige's probably setting it, setting aside station nine, it's still station two is not going to be the bottle. But that's where we're going to set this pace. So that person can just barely do bottle. Cool. Hailey, HR question. What kind of workers are we using in fabric, technical, and daughter versus here? Fabric, technical, daughter, our member property, they were both paid on the P-street. Okay. These guys are here. Here we're not paid. Oh, sorry. No, no, that's right. That's good. No. You're trying to pay that. Well, but we're not paying the P-street by, by lack of, are we? No, we're paying the night fee. Yeah, I'm just saying. Yeah, I'm just saying. Yeah, they work in fabric tech and fabric work. Oh, yeah. Okay. She's right. Well, daughter, sorry, fabric tech, that was a deal. At least before he gets shifted into that group of those, the other group. He was paying P-street. What's the like, talk about like skill level workers here? Yeah, so they have a lot of full-time workers. And then they have department workers, department workers. And then, workers at the outsource from the department. And companies, they need more help. Okay. Jumbo, we said about Arthur Moreno, like how hard it is to become a machinist. It took a lot of time. I think that's, like, years. Years when you come out of the company machinist, it can't do anything. And you've just said that we've got some potential workers here. What's their like, level of education in medical assembly? They're generally a little bit slower than the full-time workers. Okay. But this isn't minimizing, you know, people and their like value as humans here. But we can kind of take somebody who's reasonably responsible, who has good by motor skills, take them off the street. And in the course of a couple of days, they could be actually producing laptops here. We've made it something similar to an absorbent people like that. Whereas our machinists at Davideck, that's not people. Cool. This, if you think back to Econ 110, for those of you who went through this, the hammer is great. Was that a happy, or was that a curl? So it wasn't. No, no. This is like, this is a little like the Adam Smith, like, nail factory that, which is like, you've taken people and that we're working in a job shop that could make like one nail, everything from the point of the nail, to the nail, to the nail. So it's something that's much more specialized, where each person is just doing their own little part of the process. Okay. Now, really quickly, let's get a quick couple of items here on what the big picture is here. What is this debt? It's important to sheep up to like the business right now. Like what matters, don't. Staying competitive, there's a notebook box in the room, box sharing, box space in the street. Keep your heart and care. Yeah, and how do you keep marketing here by competing with the other players? Yeah, but like, what are the criteria for success here? Sound more? Okay, how do you sell more? Well, if there's a sheba, there's a manufacturing process, producing high rate, high quality, lower quality. Okay, I like the quality thing. But we could produce, if we produce a high rate, and nobody buying those, they're not good. Right, I mean, I'm with them. But I like the quality thing. Body matters here, James? Well, they say they price competitively, but they're getting undercut by it, by all of the competitors here now. So they're using share. So cost is going to matter if we can reduce cost to loss of surprise differently. Right? And responsiveness to like changes or changes in technology, being able to quickly say like, okay, this is the new thing, we need to produce it faster. Okay, this is a cool word, but I'm not sure what it means here. In fact, I'm going to put in a word that we'll also use, sometimes loosely, but what does it actually mean to have like, response of this for flexibility? I mean, if so, like your competitor comes out with a new feature that you can figure out how to put that feature into your assembly line and into your production and make, make, computers with that feature. Okay, so one of the things that we're asking this operation to do is to be able to change over quickly from one model to the next. Brad, what was the answer to question number two on the quiz? Oh, well, it was question number two. How did they know that it changed? What's the difference between the two? What's the difference between the two? Oh, I think there's on the screen, right? Like a blank thing on the screen or on the one that I said to you. Well, as far as the two, okay, they're probably some ambiguity there. Supervisor gets that, but how do the workers actually fit that table all the way to the space? They have an empty space in between the new model and then they also, the first worker can much just put this part in. I don't want to fix that. Brad, you build that? Yeah, okay. Was there not something on the screen too much? Like I said, yeah, I'm just like something that I bought. We can, we'll buy a little batch about this. Let's go look it up and then start. I just saw you twist. Was that like a sandwich? Oh, yeah, I got it right. He said, okay, got it right. Brad will leave the speaker. Okay, so we've got this operation that's actually able to like switch over skew fairly quickly. There's skew. Stop keeping him in the unit. Stop keeping him in the unit. What's this talking about? It's just a different variety of whatever. Okay, so this shirt is a skew. If I go one size up, it's a different skew. If I have the same size, but go to like red, it's a different skew. It's a, it's a unique thing. So now, if this thing, if there's the exact same shirt, same size same color, everything, it has the same skew. Cool? So if we want to switch skews quickly, we want to build an operation that allows us to do that. Are we cool? A little so far? Okay. So what are the other criteria for competitive success here? Gallen Brothers, what else do we care about? I think the computer's break every six months. Sorry. So that's a, I don't know. What are the, what are the reasons? What are the reasons? I need to be replaced. Okay. What does that mean? Like, means that we have to add. Because the computer itself breaks or like what happens every six months? I thought the computer would make it happen. Maybe some reason. No, it's not a really nice pattern. A life span? Okay, what are, okay, this, this is a different, my interpretation of life span here means that's how long that model lasts. Like iPhone 16 to iPhone 7. Okay. I was thinking it was like, we need to have a lot of computers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Basically. They also partnered with a lot of people to like increase their technology. So it comes up flexibility thing that I think they, they, their advantages, words that they invested a lot in new technologies. Okay. So we've got new models, new tech. What about, what's that person, what, where does quality in terms of your discussion here? I think they just really care about the tech there, they talk about their quality, that's the number one thing they rather have. Why? Because why do you support? That's what they're famous for, I Japanese people are famous for having your quality, right? So they, they want to, they want to produce a bad quality, it's reputation. At this sort of stage, I mean, bad buy at Chromebook from Costco for like $250. Actually, I almost, I don't know what to say, it's like, I almost feel like it's disposable. It lasts like a year, then that's awesome, or it lasts six months. This is like, at least at this sort of moment in time, these are pretty expensive. This is a, you know, a pretty big investment for an individual or for a company, buying a laptop like this. So quality matters here. And, you know, to that one point, it's probably one of the, one of the great areas that people are buying on to get from kind of success in the market share. Good job. Okay. Yes, our man. Yeah. In terms of quality, I think that, I think part of it with other companies to like innovate on the finish of the transition. Color displays, I think that's part of the quality as well. Like the color is way like better than the other models in the market. As well as videos like business, I and batteries, which was like more efficient. Okay. And could not like, you know, as quickly as possible. Cool. So I'm going to say we're asking this thing to be able to be robust to like incorporating new technology also as just as well. Okay. So, I keep just during toward this table because we're going to set up a conveyor belt here and try to like visualize what's going on here. You say yes. Where's your name, sir? That's terrible. What's your call you today? Again. Where are you going to see me? Where are you going to see me? Where are you going to see me? Where are you going to see me? Where are you going to see me? Okay. So, that was a funny aside. To me, let's find out. Okay. So, here's what I want to do. We're going to try to get our head to run how the process works, including station nine. And if we do our job well, we're going to get some insight into maybe a couple of puzzles that I have about this process. So, does that do we call Conor Ray? Nope. Sweet. Okay. I don't know that. I don't know. Yeah. Might be coming back to you though. Joseph, looking, so what is this? So, this is the time, the number of seconds, the east station takes. Or not how long it takes, but how long the person is touching the computer if I'm going to get station. Okay. What's the bottleneck step here? Forget about station nine for a minute. I would say this would let me know this one 14 as our biggest number. So, whoever is at station two, that's taken 114 seconds. So, the guy at station one, hands it over, yes, 10 4 seconds. So, station two is the guy's constant to go, because that's our bottleneck. Okay. And that's the person pays sets the face of the line at. That person is dictating the face of this. So, you probably shouldn't see that this goes at 114 seconds per lifetime. Okay. Now, let's have some fun here. And we're going to just calculate a couple of things to get our heads around the circle. So, Joseph, the case tells us how long it takes. How? Like, what's the physical length of each of these spaces on the conveyor belt? The horizontal length is, they can also have a couple length because it's 14 meters. Okay. A whole thing. And then we're going to have to well... 12 stations. So, the way I think about this, and I haven't really chosen to get up, it's kind of states in nine, eight, nine, eight, and nine, eight. That all, the group of those conveyor stations, nine. Okay. And that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, eight, nine, eight, nine, eight. 12 stations long. The overall thing is 14.4 meters. And so, that means these stations, how long? That's only how this 1.2. 1.2 bananas. I mean, they're meters. Meaders. No, since I grew up in a place that just ignores the metric system. Yeah, sorry. Can somebody, the trauma of a place where they use the right units here? How long is 1.2 meters? Show us, like, yeah, 4 feet. But for those of people that are like, you know what I'm talking about, how far is... You see this? That's not bad. Surveyed in the air how big is 4.2 meters. Okay. So, 1.2 meters is about how long? So, envision this a belt. 14.4 meters is like... It's actually probably about completed air. Yes. Each space on the belt is about this wide. And this thing pucks along. And I have a lot of popping front of me. I work on it for how long? How long is that in my room? I'll miss it. I'll try about two minutes. Let's see. Carlos, since you did such a good job with this. Carlos, turn around on the desk right behind you. And then put your finger like this up against... Yeah, I put it up against the thing. So, I'll try this. Yeah. So, I'll try to see your finger. You move people behind you. They can stick up a little bit. There we go. Now, Carlos, move your finger at... 114 seconds for every 1.2 meters. 1.2 meters in 114 seconds. No, that's too fast. I think that's too fast. So, if you take about two minutes to get from... Nephi's name tag over to Haley's name tag. So, rewind back to Nephi's name tag. Okay. Now, two minutes... Yeah. Okay. Here we go. This is it. This is how actual in real life about how fast the conveyor is going. Go ahead. It's actually... That's probably about right. So, two minutes to transit over to where Haley's name tag is. So, it's not like the Lucy and Bethel conveyor belt. It's kind of just... Chuckle on slowly and we divide up the work and make sure that... Do you know what the vision of the other work done? What is the station two? What is station two? They should be able to get... They should probably finish their job just as it gets over to Haley. Cool. So, that's kind of... That's that long conveyor belt. You notice from that corner of the dairy. It's just cutting along really slowly. But you gave up in the loop. LAUGHTER OK, we go with this up on. OK, so that's about how long it takes. Uh... Oh, good. How does station nine work? So, I'll take this down about it. I know what you're going to do about station nine. Yes. I know. So station nine has three computers at it. So, this... My opinion of this is that it's three times as long as it's normal for you. OK? So, if I'm the guy running station nine, I get a computer from the guy at station eight. OK. And I take like 30 seconds to start running some sort of software test time. Would you be worth 31? 31, yeah. OK. And then... I'm done with that guy. For a little bit. Would that guy be in that left hand? In that left hand. OK. For how long? How long is that thing at the same time? 28 seconds. 28 seconds? 28 seconds. OK. And so, then, if I do my 30 seconds with the first computer, then I'm going to go on the back end to my last computer and spend 71 seconds to finish whatever test I was running. OK. Now, there are kind of two ways to... with apologies to... Sister Swift here. The skin is cat. The skin is cat. Taylor Swift. She's got three cats in it. Yeah. She's a cat person. So, guys, I don't like. I think we should switch on the next one. We'll go tell her. What's that? I think we just did an unexpected vlog. She was in the Logan Cats. You said sister Swift, but you've added an extra barrier to your children. Oh, I get it. I get it. I think it adds a level of humor to people who have that particular right. OK. So, a couple of ways to skin this. If we believe Joseph, the list station should take 114teen, 114teen, and 114teen. The total 114teen has three. 22. 22. 3.42. 3.42. A laptop should take 342 seconds to get through this station. 31 plus 71 plus toy. I got a 3010. 310. 310. So, we should be able to the laptop spend 344 seconds in there. It's going to get 310 seconds of stuff either done to it or done on its own. It should be able to accomplish that. If you look at it from the perspective of the laptop, it should get like, 125. Well, the top itself should give like 34 seconds of inner time. But it's not either being worked on or it's not moving at some software or being like, check for 10. Another way to sort of think about this is that we're going to animate this in just a second. But, Joseph, how much actual work is going to work? You're going to see a nine after putting these two in the box. So, it's just the two ends of 31 seconds, it's less than 71 seconds. So, 31 plus 71 is 102 seconds of work. And you have 114 seconds per laptop to accomplish that work. So, the two kind of back in the way and the low ways of figuring out that you can get the work done in station 9 and the amount of time you have. Anybody stay away? Can't you turn this out? I didn't say it was so easy. He sent us a video, he wrote the whole thing on the board and was great. And the game truck can get pretty complicated to do this. But basically, the rhythm of this is a lot of times when you come into contact, let's just look at the procedure. This is a game truck and it goes. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. One, maybe you can visit your favorite maybe not this year. One of my favorite places. What's that? One of my hands away from the class today. Don't forget to hit the towel. And thank you. It's a big deal. The game is a historical challenge. The never-ending challenge. The challenge is to get the challenge out of the way. So there's our belt in reality. It's like a continuous loop. Don't worry about that. We're going to say, I'm going to give my space a red here. Here's like Station 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 9, b, 9, c, and 10. Cool. So, let's see. There's Station 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8. Can I do something? No, you're good. You're good. Okay. How about that? Probably. Probably more. So. So. So, here's what we'll do. Here's our stack of raw materials in the inventory. We're going to roll into Station 1. That'll have how it gets worked on in Station 2. So, as soon as it crosses this line into Station 2, we put one on this conveyor belt. And then, 3. And each of the people here on the line is working on their station. Joseph, how long does each person have to put a finger task? 100 to 14 seconds. Okay. So, who gets the most tender time here on the line? Yeah, they know. Station 8 does. Okay. Are we cold? Are we watching? So, this is going faster than you would think. But let's get this over here. That's not perfect, but it's kind of awesome. Whatever. Okay, cool. So, these are the little ones. You know, that's a close view of this. Who's your biggest hands the most about the energy to do thinner? This is a name. So, Station 8 here is like chill. Biggest to do a bunch of like. How much time do they, for every 114 seconds, how much time do they get to be on a dinner? At standard. 21 to that 21 seconds. 21. Okay, cool. Are we cold this so far? Oh, yeah. Here's my animation. Oh, finally. Joseph, final thing. If we're running this thing, okay, now I need you to make this out. Ready? If we're running this thing, listen. What's up with that? Oh, yeah. Okay, no, that's good. Joseph? Good. Okay. Good. Okay. How far are those perchamps? 100 or 40 seconds. Do you like that? That's a good one. So, if some of you in your hands right now are, even though we calculated little for our last time, are still a little bit unclear as the difference between cycle time and throw-off time. Yep. Watch this. Okay, so we said there's a chunk of 114 seconds. Joseph, approximately, watch this. Is it going to be awesome? Okay. Stop watch. Okay. I'm going to put this one on this line. Here is the root point time. Ready? Start. Okay. Joseph, this right now calculating how long it's going to take, watch, listen. Okay. This curchunk isn't all there. But there's a curchunk. Can I have a 14 seconds? Curchunk. A 14 seconds? Curchunk. How long is it going to take with this unit, curchunk's off, Joseph? Watch. What's going to be the time? What should get us out? Watch. When that curchunk's off. Not 1,300, 60 seconds or 22 points. So how did you get that? 114 times 12. It gives you 1,300, 60. Is it 1368? Second. Okay. So some of you, and this is not a bad thing, are still going to be a little bit wrapped around the axle on like, I don't understand what psychopathic is. It's a curquatite and we just saw it really draw for yourself in your notes what we just did. What we just did was an illustration of time between those curchunks. Are we 14 seconds per unit or the overall time should have taken to get that one unit all the way through was 1360 seconds? Cool? Cool. Okay. If I, and the final thing to, whoa, look at that, finished and then you're going in there. You can actually grow up on the lapis. What's happening? What's happening? That's a two percent. Or a horny stomp down it. Did you do that? Okay. Okay. Final thing I want to do here, well, let's just quickly illustrate Joseph for everybody that's trying to do their heads around this. What does station nine, as you described it, and I agree with your description, let's look at what station nine looks like from a cadence perspective where the person is working with. So we're going to give it like a rolling chair. Okay. Here's a number eight. This is a person that's in here. They're doing 93 seconds of work and then they're like on Tinder for a while, whatever. Their laptop comes into station nine a. So this is the one we're looking at here. What happens as it comes into station nine a. I'm sitting here, station nine. Sorry. What happens? I start loading whatever is off with. For how long? Two seconds. So I'm giving 100 seconds of loading. How many seconds of logs have you seen here for me? 31 seconds. 31 seconds of attention. New logs. I'm going to start seeing for checking out. So 31 seconds of log to this thing. And then what happens in that one? And then I don't touch it for a 200 and eight seconds. Then it's going to sit there just thinking, worrying away, doing its things. What's out there is the name while loading the software. Okay. Do it in that. For 208 seconds. And then Monty in his can't chart. Probably there are a couple of decisions you could make about it. Which way to push this here or there. But it's going to work out that he has to do 102 seconds of labor here. There's going to be 200 and eight. There's going to be some extra time with the laptop. Just kind of sits. Nine are getting love, nor worrying. It's got its own time. It's going to connect with other devices on the network. Okay. So this goes along here. Joseph and Bill. Seven one seconds left. And then what? And then what? And then I finish doing what I was doing. A re-engage with it. Okay. So my cadence is all day. If I'm station nine, I just go on 9A31, 9C71. It's a positive. 9A, 9C, 9A, 9C. That's just my cadence is I'm just going back and forth between 9A and 9C. And I've got a little bit of weight time made there that I can... Because I have 140 seconds to accomplish 102 seconds of stuff. So are we cool with this so far? Okay. Now... Can anybody think of a more efficient way to configure this system here? What would you do to make it more efficient? Peter, you got our both bottom 9K at station two that is a... See, 21 seconds difference from our... Stage eight is about to be there. Okay. Peter's about to say something super deep. And I want you to think really carefully about what he says and evaluate whether you agree with the city thought or down the path. I think I took my hand on that question. Okay. Peter says station two is fully occupied all the time. Okay. It's got a lot of operations going on. This is taking 40 seconds. We can chop up one of those operations. Why not chop up like one of those little bit earlier or a little bit later, even like we can figure some stuff and move it and like help smooth out the line? Roll with overall. You could allow age if you could make this like like lower and down to like... In fact, what's the average... What's the average like a cycle time here like ideally? If you've told them up all of those numbers, take out station nine for a second or make it one or two. What's the average like actual work somebody's doing on this? That's it. Saturday I'm going ahead but you're not going to get that. It should come up to... Sorry. I had a few minutes. 12 times on it for running operations is 258 seconds. So you're going to have to start 105. Okay, fine. That's cool. Are we both this issue? So let's say on... So what Peter is saying is... We've got this like... We're going to try to sound fancy. We've got heterogeneous operating times across these stations here. If we could figure out a way to like really really down this down... We could go from like summer 114, summer 93. We could get down to like an average, preserving the number of people in the line of like something like 103 seconds all the way at 105 seconds all the way across. Cool. Peter. This depends on it. The operations need to be in this series. Okay. If you take one off two, it may be moving. They probably have to be serial but like... Let's say we have like a year like work on this. We could possibly squeeze that and do this. Okay. What a bunch of idiots. Like why don't they do that? What do you think? Why are they doing this down? Because they said always the number one thing and the last step of... Well he doesn't. The last step of the season. They're setting up the screws for the next thing. But you could do that in his thing. Yeah, so if you were to move the screws to the next person doing it, that way I actually push more time on to 8 and less time on to... Okay. So then if you do that then they said that they have seen the same quality by having the screws done by a previous person. And they said quality is the number one most important thing. They drive a few quality and they get faster. Good. Like does that in order to maintain quality they have a allow for this 21-hp discrepancy or if you're to move the screws by a metal rail like six seconds less for step two. And I imagine six seconds for step eight or something. So essentially that it becomes a 15-hp discrepancy and step 21 seconds. It might even be better. But they decided that they'd rather keep the quality maintained instead of improving this key. Okay. I think one of the good answers to this question, like why should we do what Peter said? We seem like a pretty good idea to like equalize all of these and make it work is maybe it's actually the purpose of quality. And if we move around this like some of these steps, what's our quality? What's our quality level when you have now? It's a two percent defect rate or... Hold on. Okay. This is going pretty cool. Two percent defect rate. Okay. What does that mean? Two of them are bad. Two of them are bad. Okay. Let's... And then of which, how many are actually people's problems? Okay. So 5% of those, 2% are operator error. So let's... Somebody's going to help you with the calculator math here. 5% times 5%. Equals what? That's all what? 0.01. 0.01 or 0.1%. 0.1%. 0 will 0.1% of last cut have a problem. So 5% plus cause by or... 2% of that have a problem. 5% of those have a problem caused by a worker. So 5% of that cost produce have a problem caused by a worker. Okay. What's our rough like daily output? How many are we making? We're making 114. We're making a laptop every 114 seconds and at our day. Somebody help us out here. We're making 236 laptops a day. Okay. So we're making 236 laptops a day. How did you get that? 7.5 hours. 7.5 hours. 9.60 minutes. 9.60 minutes per hour. 3.3 hours. That's why we're making 226 laptops a day. We're making 226 laptops a day. We're making 226 laptops a day. We're making 226 laptops a day. We're making 216 laptops a day. We're making 236 laptops a day. Would we actually have 7.5 hours? Okay. So we're... Oh, I'm just focusing on the whole line. Yes. Okay cool. The vats can actually work out the same here either way. The little quickens I'm going to have. So, of the, just hang in here, just like, don't write this down, or you can't have to write it up. Just like, think about this. Alex, we're making 236 laptops a day. 0.1% of those have a due effect. How many, how many bad laptops are being generated by a person per day? Okay. So, about how frequently is somebody making this, like, is a record of this? So, we're making 236 a day, about how frequently does somebody have a line make a mistake that was not going to allow for a backup effect? It's like every four a days. Every four days are a mistake. The worker causes? What's every, every one of the, yeah, what's a week? We have 10 workers, so let's divide it evenly among them. That means once every 10 weeks, you make them a mistake, you're sitting on the line. That's pretty, that's pretty much. I'm literally sitting here every almost two minutes, I'm just putting in screws on these laptops and I pass along. It's all I do all day every day. It's mad at the look, it's like every 40 days, every 10 weeks I actually cause a mistake. Like, that's pretty remarkable. And it gets back to the Galaxy. Okay. Why else might we not worry about doing the Peter plan and like fully, fully, fully optimizing this thing? And the question is asking what happens if you have five inexperienced people who take 10% longer time? If you have five people who are inexperienced, if you take 10% longer, then the signifying goes to about 160. Okay. Jacob, I love this. Jay, I don't know if you have your hand up for this one. I ask you a question. We bring in, what percent of our workers are temps? 25. I think 25% is going to be whatever. 25% of workers have our temps. So you bring in somebody off the street because not super well trained in this. What station do you put that person on? 8. Why? Because it's got the biggest bandwidth to be able to have a 10% increase in time. And what's the very, like, which station do I put my best person on? 1, 2, 2. Now, do you see this? So this is pretty cool. This thing can right now having heterogeneous processing times allows us to accommodate heterogeneous workers in a pretty cool way. Because unfortunately, well, I guess this is almost like a religious question. Unfortunately, we can't force everybody to be robots and have the same exact operating time. That would have been an amazing plan, actually. What's that? We all would have made it. Unfortunately, people with all robots, that's not the world we live in. We live in a world where we get differences that are beautiful, apparently. We don't know what we're just doing. We don't know what's happening. No failure. It seems like a pretty good plan. Peter says, maybe we don't want to fully optimize this system. Because this thing actually right now with imbalance actually allows us to accommodate people if we run it correctly. Putting the fast people on station 2 and the slow people on station 8, that's cool. Okay. Can different workers? Why else might we not want to do theaters fully, fully optimize this line out? Are we assuming that changing operations doesn't change the process of speed of that? Well, what do you think would happen? John asks a really interesting, I think my interpretation of your question is this. My joy in the long, John, I forgot what skew this was. What skew are these laptops right here? Okay, this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That's the skew of this particular laptop, S64, GXM, blah blah blah, S3M and blah blah blah. Yeah, that's a fast stuff. I don't know this is a smooth amount of emails. Okay. These are skew, so these are all identical. Okay, Carolyn, you said this at the beginning, what happens when we are switching over to skew 1, 2, 3, 4, 6? Okay, so we're going to inject a little bit of inefficiency in the system by letting one blank spot go down the line before the next skew comes along. Okay, that's what that works like. Cool. John, why are we willing to count in this level of inefficiency before we use them? Why are we willing to absorb an air hole when we got that line? I'm just going to assume that we can keep our quality in. Okay, what is it? What is it? Does that think you're right? It might be like, okay, everyone can look up at the screen which also changes. How long do you go? It's like, okay, so I'm doing that. It's like, I'm not going to do any MBA. It's like, I kind of argumented it. But also, maybe if someone wants a drink of water, once every seven and a half hours, you're something like that. Estation 2, yeah, it's like so third-stitiation 2. Jack, I was going to say it's just sometimes you get in a rhythm of doing this stuff. Yeah, it's a break up rhythm. Cool. Why are they doing that thing? Yeah, third-stitiation? Sorry. I feel like some worker just working on screen, some worker just working on the keyboard. And then you have to flip that over and do the different thing. Yeah, it's like this is a raster rhythm and then I will have a question. Well, I think that's right. Enter the second question. The first question is why are we willing to count in this inefficiency of taking that point of thought. And then it's also when they're passing around the new instrument. Yeah, okay. So this basically is a way for us to set this thing down the line. We're setting up for another type of skew. They're setting in the new tools and new kits for the new laptops. So we're doing that. So, Sean Jun says, and then an answer to a different question, which is kind of the answer to John's question, okay, you guys get working on this. What happens? Okay, look at this. What happens to station 3's description of work when we go from this one? And then there's a blank spot. Thank you. And then we set up this one. What happens? We actually, I don't know. It may not even be in the case. What do you suppose could happen to station 3 as they switch from this one to this one? What happens to their description of work? What's the station 3? Oh, okay. So I don't know why I called you this, but skew12345 has an LCD screen. It's skew12346, but what an artistic has a OLED screen. Thank you, guys. And it has a little bit of a total of that. What's that? So, a generic answer maybe to John's and Sean Jun's like insect gear is from one day to the next station 3 might have a totally different kind of job description. That seems inefficient to me because I read, I'm just meant about the pin factory. And Ab Smith said, roughly speaking, they're against some specializations. What we just said is it used to be, it's a really good thing to have station 3 focusing on solid LCD screen and folding and slightly k-walls and screwing the train, et cetera. And what we just said is that periodically when we switch skews station number 3 is going to do something totally different. That runs to me, seems like inefficient because we basically said you were one kind of worker 3 days ago and today you're a different kind of worker. Why not fully, fully optimized? It's like a demo of the same thing. Oh, there it is. Well, like the laptops are changing all the time anyway. What would be a beautiful world if the marketing people didn't get involved? Sorry. We just made one last talk all day or day for like the crowd. You have a known buyer set up. You can take same plan and not just have a client to the worker in the factory but also to consumers. So they just have the same thing all day or day. It seems like a modest proposal. Capitalism. What? Capitalism? What's capitalism? You always want people to come back and buy more than the newest one even if they don't necessarily want to. Okay. So you're attempting people to get the newer features but then you have to teach them how to do new stuff. Hey, Amin, what's your time to that? Well, just kind of go along with it. It's said that we produced eight different types of models and there's only three lines. Why, that seems so stupid. Why do the workers do the things to do that? Maybe there's a different market they were trying to get. That's super annoying. We'll get paid more. You have more, they're different. You're seeing there are different kinds of people out there? Yeah. And it'll be so great if they weren't all different kinds of people. All right. Yeah, Jen? Wouldn't it be kind of like Doridori? Like you don't want to have a work production or something that's not in the cell. Okay. Okay. I want to address this. I'm being a little bit funny in my mind. So, 76, 76, amin, say this really interesting thing. What is it that we're trying to optimize here, kind of projecting by the expanding of your work? What is it we're trying to optimize here? Peter said we could if we really wanted to, like really dial this thing in, and get it perfectly balanced and get it like really, really focused on making one kind of laptop. I'm bellishing. One of the reasons that we don't want to do this is that there are different kinds of consumers and consumer cases change because we want to be able to change every day, daily, help regularly, probably, or are we coming out with a new model? Six months? Like every six months or so. Now, what happened to, I don't know, the actual price of the car, what happened to it? The price of the iPhone 16's the other day. Drop down the books. Why do we have to, how many? It's Alex. What was it, what did the price go from what to what, do you remember? Anybody know what the price got last? 300 books. 300 all, can I start? For my phone 17, my phone? 16 is 17 because there are maybe like two more books. Okay, so how many, this is a conceptual question, probably, but I bet you could figure it out, kind of left, right, if you could get some numbers. How many of the iPhone 16's are in the Apple system someplace that are going to have to get this company in the company? Where would those things be? Like how would you account those up? Right? Store inventory, ones and trends. Where's the store inventory? Like in the physical retailers. Okay, that's one place that you've got a bunch, you've got a pile of boxes of iPhone 16's, that you've got a discount that are sitting in the store. Right? Yeah, I think like most Apple stores, they have low stock. Why? Because these trends. This is the thing, right? Okay, so they're trying to run that kind of lean. Where are some other completed iPhone 16's in the system that they're going to have to discount? Apple warehouses. There's some distribution center. There's back at the factory in China. There's some pile up there. And then what about in the middle? How do they get, how do iPhones get from China to the US? They're on a ship in the middle. Actually, they don't want ships, you know where they ship them? 747. If you want to have a fun time thinking about this sometime, it's super expensive. It's expensive. And they're super high value. And think about this. What's the transit time to get a ship from China to the US? 30 days. Two weeks, 30 days. So we can actually figure out how much time it looks like a conveyor just like this. How long it takes to get from, we know what the daily command is. We can look at how many days it takes to go across the ocean. That's how many of those things are on ships at 700 bucks a month. And all the ones are out on the ship in the middle of the ocean. When the day that we announced the 17, those all have to give it down and put on sale. That actually turns out it's cheaper if those are on a 747. Now, if you ever want to have fun thinking about this, where you insurantly minded people, think about what happens if one of those things goes down. Oh, I like it. Yeah. So if you have how much, just figure out how much an iPhone weighs and figure out what the cargo capacity is, Q or weight of a 747, I think you've got $5 billion worth of laptops on one of those planes when they do it. It's not. And one of those things, I don't know who insures those, but I have to think it's a pretty significant thing. But part of the reason you do that is, what's the time to take the iPhone to make the iPhone to the US? 12 hours. So it's the number of iPhones you have to put on sale. 16 to put on sale. You introduce the 17, and the way you bring that. There's a similar set of dynamics here, which is, every hardware, every one there comes up with a new model, dating. We're frequently coming out with few models. Santa says, unfortunately, people on robots are consuming robots, and we have to switch over models really quickly. Running this really lean. Essentially, we just have like one day or two worth of production here. We switch over quickly to match whatever consumer demand is happening on the side of the skew. We're keeping this really lean, so we don't have to have a bunch of T-Seeba laptops in inventory that we have to write down on, put on sale or center-ros, press for less when the new one comes out. Cool. Back to Peter's question. Peter, why don't you fully squeeze every last little bit of kinder time out of this factory? It seems that the furry model that we are producing, that is slightly more than a chain of equipment. And what is it that we really want to disband if you do well-thrust? We're going to use that high quality and add quality standards. Quality standards? Like, like, shame, shame. We want to be able to change over really, really cool. Now, just for fun, these approximate, we might have done this in your notes. What's the labor content in one of these laptops approximately? Like, the tool work time? Total work, this is total love, plus total tender time. Take tender time out, I don't care. Total love, how much actual hands-on love is what I want to ask you, like, who feels like most unequipped to answer this question? Is that enough? So much. Do you have like this? Seven. You're going to talk to your body out, yeah. Well, somebody already sent it earlier. Okay. Now, you're making her more nervous. You said it instead of engaging with this, you said what? Who said what? Seven. Go. Focus on it. Don't worry about it. Okay. Seven. Okay. Here's our focal length. We're going to watch this one. Okay. Comes into station one. How much love is it getting in station one? Like, hands-on. 110. 110 plus how many seconds of tender? Four seconds. So depending on your account, direct labor content, if you're going to account active labor content, plus idle labor content, or just call it labor content, which is generally going to be phone. How many seconds of love is this getting from? 114. 114 seconds. Next station, 10. 114. Next station. 114. Next station. 114. If you had to like play this all the way through, let's figure out how much labor content this thing is going to get in it on its way through the diagram. Roughly 30. 1360. 1368. 1368. So in my case, you take off a little bit of this like fermentation time in the middle here. It looks like in real people terms, how much, how many hours is 1368 seconds? 22 minutes. So like, okay, is 22 minutes, this laptop is getting in love as it goes along. Totally unfair question because you weren't even born yet when this case was good. And about how many dollars or again or whatever is 22 minutes of labor, what do you think? Like two bucks. Two bucks, fine. Wow, that's really good. So because you, this is like, we're paying them $6 an hour. Yeah. We're paying them a third. It's Asia. What's that? It's Asia. It's the expensive part of Asia. Okay. So if you took $30 an hour, then we'd be at like $10 an hour. Think about this. We're selling this laptop for like $2 or $3,000. And we're sitting here spending a whole hour of your valuable time quibbling over $2 to $10 a labor. We just waste an hour. You go on, I'm just saying here. We spent a whole bunch of time figuring out like labor content here, understanding this process. And we just realized that honestly it doesn't matter that much. In this factory, all we're doing is adding about $2 to $10 worth of COGS, cost of goods sold to this laptop. Why don't we waste all of our time? Our time? Yeah. No. Well, we just spent, right? This is like a tenth of a percent of the value of this laptop. I think by understanding that like where you need to spend your time optimizing, like this isn't that serious. I like that. Peter, do we waste our time? No. Why? That's going to answer a question. Similar to seven, we forgot that we have that as a competitive advantage. We need to move something, try and get these in our front. Cool. I love this. Now, we're going to have to move. Okay. A lot of times when we look at things, it seems like what we're focusing on is efficiency and minimizing cycle time and all of that stuff. What we see here in this particular factory is aware of some different goals that we're using to serve, that we're all leads of the business. In particular, flexibility and quality are really important criteria. We're not as worried about cost in this particular situation. The bigger costs are going to be having to discount a $3,000 laptop by 30% when it sits in inventory someplace. So we're willing to eat some of the efficiency here in order to make that problem less as we move to the supply chain. Now, to just finally paint a bright order around this question that I asked Peter before, why not fix this thing up so that it's really good? It's okay. It's okay because we want to stay to sometimes incorporate workers that are lower skilled, sometimes higher skilled, and we're actually wanting this thing to make higher quality and have more flexibility for us. Flexibility here has a very specific definition. It's not just flexibility, like yoga or some business flexibility. Business flexibility here specifically means how costly is it for us to change over for one to another? In this case, all of this is one little bubble and a little bit of extra tender time that we've built into the process. But in return for that, we're able to make this really responsive to what changes happen in customer demand, both from the introduction of new models and from changing over to skew to the next day of the day. Cool. Next time, what are we doing on Wednesday? Oh, we're not here. We're not here. You're either going on one of the trips or there's an intensive here with career services. Next time, we see each other will be next Monday. We're going to be doing chocolate things. We'll be going to spend a lot of time on that. Thank you."
