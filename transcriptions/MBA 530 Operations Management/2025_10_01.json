  "text": "Look, Rudy. What, which fruit? Yeah. Right. You're right. Hey. Now, have every part of the milk and then you chew it up. Get a smell. Every part of the tongue, like. Run, run, run, run. Not the tip. Well, you got to wait. Oh, you said that's the two. No, it's the tip. It's the tip. Not all of the pieces. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I haven't tasted that before. Oh, my goodness. That's good. That's good. That's good. We like it. This is so much fun. I'm just being a little bit bananas. I think that's real fun though. It's not cool. Power suggestions. I'm really, really good. This isn't good. That's just my work. That's just my work. That's just my work. That's just my work. What work are you expecting? Now that you've been expecting a lot more fruit for it. That's pretty interesting. Yeah, I can sense a little bit of banana. Definitely a little bit more chocolate. We've been a lot trying it. Oh, interesting. Well, I think that it's worth it. I did not taste it. Okay. It's a raspberry. It's a raspberry. How was it? Let's try it. Let's try any other job. Let's try this one from... This is a great one. Who said that? Jared's not a believer. Correct. It's okay. This one's from Madagascar. So let's try it. Oh, whoa. I think... What did you put the back half? I know. That was... That was a good... The Hershey's pencil bit. Oh, wow. Okay. It's like the dark butter. Oh, the misty part is... It's all over now. Lindsay doesn't like it. Wait a minute. I don't know that we're... I'm not super sophisticated. Let me at a very basic level. You just have to do those two things. Absolutely. Okay. So we'll pass this around. Okay. We just take a plate and start it on a rose someplace. Make sure that you get two different flavors so that you can... There may not be enough for every person to get everyone like ghost, dimatic, and whatever Madagascar piece they have. But just cut it half. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hold on. She's... Oh, my gosh. So... So... Did this pass me around? Make sure you get two flavors. And then... And then... And then... Like, do you know how much you're doing right now? Just like that. Oh, this is... Like, do you have a... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Killin' this. There's a five down the good for the camera there. Oh, it wasn't the camera. Oh, hey! This way. No, it didn't... It's for the camera. It's for the camera. Hey, I didn't hit it with the... I don't like dirt. I don't like dirt. It's for the camera. Lindsay's not even free. It's for a group. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. Here's what we gotta do. Tiffany. Jack Rodney. I said, baby, it's like the ball. I'm gonna give you a three. You start it and then it'll go to the back. Is that all? A little more? Yeah, come on. It's for the camera. It's for the camera. It's okay. It's okay. These are all... All the ones were passed down at 70 percent. Like, three... Like, whatever that's kind of the... No, we're not. Investment grade, gold standard, chocolate percentage. Does anybody here in chocolate like this kind of chocolate? Why do you guys... You guys seem so comfortable. They're so plain. What do you guys... I got my fingers dirty. I'm here right now. This is bitter. It's bitter. It's too bitter. Like, what kind of chocolate are you like? Hershey's. Yeah, they look like Hershey's. Don't let milk chocolate ball in. I need to put it in too. It's pretty good. Milk chocolate. Yeah, yeah. Finish chocolate. Oh my gosh. She knows. Anything you can build. Okay. Were you up on your killing as part of Scandinavia? Well, that's... It's a gray area. I don't want to. It's dirty. I don't want to get... They're dirty. There we go. It's pretty good. It looks like Scandinavia, right? Here on. What did you guys do? It was good. Try guys. It was not. Well, those... I don't think I'm... I don't think I'm... I'm not saying very things. Oh, there. Even stuff there that don't take you down the line. It's like, 25 or 25. Are we going to buy wider money? Yeah, I'm going to buy wider money. The worst one I have, I'm sorry. I'll hear it. Yeah. What I had in the comments. I was really sorry. Did you get any? I'm sorry. Did you get any? It was a great question. That was a great question. You want to spoke with me like this? All right. You got to, you got to take it like this. So, I've got to talk to him. I knew I shouldn't have done that. Basically. Here's what we got to do here. We got to understand this business. I'm a single product. And they got some existing challenges. Together's going. Tiffany, funny enough. You got to talk about your own. Tiffany. Tell us about the big picture about the product here. This world marketing is about us. How we can describe Amy's product. The product is about this product. I don't know if it's the product. The product is the product. The product is the product. And their field is like more of the higher part. It's simply kind of chocolate. So, they're not competing at some other stores. I'm pretty familiar with what we're talking about. Getting the more bold times feel of making these things with the bar of chocolates and selling it into our artist's in market. So, kind of like the same market as wine. Like wine, kind of? Like that finer thing. The finer thing. And it's... Tell us about the price point. What is the point? What is the relative to the kind of chocolate those guys that you're looking for? I would say it's quite... So, I'd say it's from Stonyley from $12 to $13 for the product. I think that's the biggest. Okay. Yeah. It gives us like a multiple of what just relative to the rate of feedback. So, this is like... This is an expensive stuff. Tell us more about the product. They... They... They're... They're... What's the use case for this? Like, who? Like, when you buy and consume it. Um... You're having the party of 15 people? You're sniffing chocolate as those drugs are not... Um... Okay. Sort of like Stonyley and all of these things. And also, they said that they sell to like... I guess they're strong too. So, they can use it in their desserts. They can be higher end. Wishing stores. Wishing stores. Yeah. It's getting a little bit, you know, like, channels, though. But, yeah, this is like... This is good stuff. Um... I was pretty... Actually, charcoal murder was like the... One of the really first chocolate makers in the US doing this kind of being some art thing. Um... And... I didn't really kind of believe this stuff because I've been... You know, skeptical about like wine tasting and whatever. Like, life and... You know what I mean? And they would take like... A bean out of a pile and... They'd be like breaking open. Like literally just the... Got me going. That one's from Venezuela for like... Two years ago. That one's from... You know, whatever, coastal weekend. That one's from... Like... They're something here. Like... Anybody here like a... Or a fancy car. Who likes... Who likes to visit their cars? They want to. Fancy cars. Or like... Well, like who likes to visit our car? James. If you're feeling air, what car are you going to buy? 911. General, 911. What? It's like my favorite car. Which 911? Oh, car. It's a Porsche. What are those? You know, 1.4. Yeah. GT3 RS. GT3 RS. Okay. This is interesting. GT3 RS. How fast do you get? Like, until... So, 3. 3. Yeah. How much do you get? GT3 RS cost? 4. 4. That's like a quick get going. Probably if you got to get on a free-get-trained, it's going to be maybe 3. Yeah. Okay. $350,000 for a stupid car. For a Benz-Jax. I want to make a little heroic plan here. For most of us, if I put a blindfold on you, and put earplugs in, and put you in my wife's Tesla, and floor it, you wouldn't be able to tell everyone's sweet enough to get on the car. It could be fired. No, Tesla might be faster. That's why I said earplugs. Why would you spend $350,000 on something that's like no different from regular life air and water? Well, I mean, the same reason why someone was like this chocolate. I put up like getting these magazines in the mail and I put them in the car and just keep it on. There's like a connection with something deeper about it. Yeah, that's very cool. Other hands, the other hands, stuff like this people are into. No, the first time I was very distinct, handling on the road. Oh, yeah, they can handle pretty well. Well, and it's different from other hands. I mean, I don't want to know, she's like that cheaper, crappier, or Corbett, like, 0.6 is actually definitely the easier one. That's probably more like a thinner boomer. You see? He would spend three X on a car because there's something like a sibling. He doesn't want to be that guy with a grey goatee and no chains right around us. We want to be a Bitcoin. That's what it's like. That's like a Gaysa Bitcoin. Yeah, honey, I'll be a premium for good produce. Oh, really? What? Wait, what's good produce? Good produce is like scuff that is, okay, it's not Walmart shipping methods where it comes out produce and it's all produced in bulk. I've said some decent stuff that's not bruised. Some of them are fine. Some of them are fine. I think all of us, as a lot of Americans, are we students who are doing like eating really good strawberry and even ones that basically taste like pepper? Yeah, they're kind of all, if they're red, they taste about, how much are you willing to spend, how many X would you spend on a good strawberry versus a crab? Depending on my level of confidence, like five times more. Five X. Oh, I'm a hair... Is anybody here? I'm a corny. Is anybody here? This is a delicate question. What's a Birken bag? Hey, what's a Birken bag? A Birken bag is that Airman's bag that's like very... It's a very expensive bag. It's a bit like you can. How much did you spend on this? For like a small bag like $10,000. And a nice one? And a nice one like probably upwards of $75. $75,000? $75,000. $75,000? Yeah. There must be a really big bag for you. No, they're probably big. You can't, but that's the big one. That's interesting. Why would you spend that much on a bag? Like, what is it that you're buying by that bag? The reputation. There's no reputation as a brand. What do you like? How do they make those their makesbacks? I'm sure handmade. By whom? By Italian cobbler. Oh my goodness. You can get... What do you like for your... I never, never gonna afford a burger. I love that. Yes, you can. Yeah, sure. Offense by NBA. You want to go when you can. Totally. Yeah, sure. Here's what I want to say. This is interesting. And kind of a little bit goes to our questions here that we have. Why don't you just go buy a fake one? They have... One of my... When I can't sleep at night, YouTube's got me figured out. They'll like... I've got on YouTube and it'll show me like... The production process for like a super, super high-end knockoff for him, bad. You could go get one of those things made of Vietnam by like a really, really talented craft person. You know, soup to not see me get the whole thing, it's got me amazing. And it's got a cost like $200. Yeah. Why wouldn't you just get one of those and say $75,000? Well, unfortunately, you talked to the wrong girl. Because I probably would. But... Why would somebody... Think that. Like, go buy those things. Why would they buy them a bomb? $75,000. Oh. Instead of the $200. Like, you're practical. Well, because... Because one, they probably can and two, it's like, well, I bought the real thing. Why would I buy... Like, it's the brand-making thing. Well, what is special about a little French cobbler... At last. Whatever, making this stuff last forever. Making this versus like, you know, like a kid in a factory and being a non-making. Oh. I think it's such a bad thing. Okay, so there's some like, status you know that that thing is actually... Yeah, I'm more educated. I'm more educated. I make more money. By the way, those Italian-made things that I probably made in China last year... It's made in English. I think that's what I was thinking. I was thinking about it. Yeah. No? That was a ball thing. Yeah, but that being least funny for you is good. By the way, you know, we were saying this five years ago, nobody said what about like, how many more cars? That's like, Tesla's a somewhat better, but like, Chinese electric cars pretty, they're good. The Americans want to steal it. I guess I think more of a drop-reast. You think about something like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alex, I can demonstrate this exactly right now. The shoes I'm wearing currently. Oh, yeah. These are... If you go to Silicon slopes, this is what all of the other people wear. Let's see. Show us, show us. My billionaire brother-in-law wears, like, he has like bunch of pairs of these. So my wife would kill me for admitting this in public. These are not real. She wouldn't hide it. She wouldn't hide it. Get out of here, elders. My name is Alex. So this, my size on the resell market is probably between $1,200 and $2,000 for this person. What I saw you were those ones. Yeah. But they're my favorite shoe I've ever made. Awesome. And I'm not going to spend $2,000 on something, but I'm going to be walking around dirt and sweating. And so I like the shoe. I've never once tried to pass it off as real. I wear them. I wear them. I wear them. And so... Forgive me. It's not a status thing. It's just that I just like we love this shoe. I'm getting ready to order my new pair of shoes. What a challenge you think, for Nike, by the way. But yeah, I don't know that there's something. No, it's something I actually don't make me. There's no way they're out. I have no perfect demonstration as well. How much did you guys spend on this? You spent $20 and China full surplus. So this is surplus from the actual factory that made those. But it doesn't have iPhone logo on it. But it's compatible to everything that I've done. It's the same week during the last day. You can bring it up. There it is. I want to just like... I like something there. Actually, let's... Tiffany, I put one of your comments there, over to the right, because Stuart, how would you describe the process of being made to use the China here? Traditional? Okay, so it's almost impossible. Tiffany messed up doing this, no offense. Talking about the product to bring in some discussion of the process that's being used to make the product. Alex and Chaujou here are able to like disentangle these two things. They're cool with the actual thing that this thing does. But a big part of the reason that, you know, page in three years would be only by $75,000 bad. It's like just a good feeling to get associated with this stuff. James likes the idea of some, you know, heard of German engineers sweating over the last little microsecond of shock absorber responsiveness on the nerve-wrong, as they tune this thing. And I give you like, that's a big part of what you're buying. Is the process used to generate this product? So you guys are wrong about the earbuds and whatever those things are and the shoes. But that's kind of like the part of the market we're playing in. It's almost like inseparable from the process. Other things are the process that are distinctive. I mean, they're using ancient machines. All the equipment? What's cool about that? I guess that kind of plays in the traditional nature of it, but it makes it like when the people come to the factory, they are able to see this is like how chocolate has been made to the beginning of time. It feels more real. This is awesome. Well, we should circle back to this. Stuart, in fact, if we don't return to a discussion of this by 35 or 40, 10 or 5 or 10 minutes left, we raise our hand. We're going to get back and just wrap this up. Cool. Who feels like, now we're going to have to just kind of fast. Actually, Stuart, if you had to like, you bump into like a recruiter in the elevator. Like, what case did you do? I just started moving. What's the core issue here that Jim's facing? He has a traditional like chocolate production line, but he has demands for more than he can produce. A lot of people that want this chocolate experience. And so he wants to give that to more people, but without hurting the quality, without lowering his brand value. This is very well said. This is a serious challenge. It's actually a challenge you all really like to have if you're going to start something up. It's pretty remarkable. So they start from like basically nothing. They feel the brand that is, you know, in Trader Joe's, a demands grown at time. At this sort of point in time, they've actually done like a double level of difficulty in doing a startup, which is, you know, I'm not a great advisor, but some of you are doing a startup. You came to me and said like, what do you think of my business? I would tell you like, first thing, go find some market need and address it. It's like, you know, whatever, offers 101. Trying to like persuade people that they need something, that they don't realize they need, is actually pretty challenging. Like that's a extra level of difficulty at this point. And they've actually pulled this off. That's probably part of the reason that they have these factory tours and the museum and stuff, is like the process is part of the product. You're trying to educate people like, who doesn't like this chocolate? People like Alex don't like this chocolate, you like this. So we have to actually persuade you that this is something you like and we have to like, grow this thing. And we want to, what's this called, blah blah blah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, don't lower. We're trying not to like lower the handers lower the whole thing. And this is actually like a really nice challenge to have. Our ops are having a hard time keeping up the demand growth. So what we are trying to do is like solve a real serious business problem here. And as we generally do a class, so we're trying to like understand how this fits into the big picture. And in order to figure out what to do here, we're going to take it out now and do a process. That's the way we do this in all these cases. So we're going to pick about the process now. But keep in mind what we just talked about with Stuart. We're trying to like to prove the process and we demand without hurting that like aura of cool stuff that is causing global virus. Cool? Okay. Who feels like they could walk us through the numbers here on the, on the, on the the brush cluster? John? Cool? No, we're just going to say something. Yeah, we're just saying something. All right? Okay, so here's what we're going to do. We're going to try to do this fairly quickly. You want everybody to keep up. And our goal is going to be we're going to try with each of these steps to get to something that is like, uh, and Johnny might have done this differently. But I want to, I want to get us down to expressing capacity in terms of kilograms per day. Okay. You did permit. So get your calculator out. All right. Get your calculator out to help John. We're going to, we're going to have to do it. So in order to get kilograms per day of each of these steps, again, we're trying to get our heads around this because in the service of, uh, any of the piece of capacity, John, uh, let's start on the beam beam. Yeah. Uh, 100 or 200 kilograms by, so do I need to fill over? Okay. So kilograms per batch, uh, John says it's 200, okay? I'm sorry, two or two requests. Okay. Every 15 minutes. Uh, and then we have our cycle time is point two. I'm going to put this in terms of hours. That's okay. Yeah. Point two five hours. Cool. Then what? That produces... Oh, let's just work on how many machines, how many of these clears do we have? One. One. You got one. Uh, okay, so let's, uh, let's calculate, how do we calculate kilograms? Oh, let's do, let's do hours per day where we can go right into it. Eight hours a day. Eight hours a day. Okay, John. Yes. Somebody took my math, but 799.8. Uh, yeah. Three for this. Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six. Okay. Okay. It's actually 61.44 what I got? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 61.44 kilograms per day. Yeah. Oh, is that per day or not per day? Yeah. Yeah. Because we're going to have a couple of different, we're going to have like one of the, uh, six, it says like 16 hours a day, you have to shift something. One day, can we get a yield percentage of something up there? I don't even know what that means. What's it John? What's your target on? Well, once we move on from this, we're going to only deal about 96 percent. Okay. So we're going to do, uh, kilograms per day, uh, call this like intake. Yeah. And then we can do killer, uh, you know what? We do like a yield. And then we can do kilograms per day, uh, output. What? Mod, he says, the answer to the quiz question. Is that right? Yeah. It's up down. The 61.44, I did my math right, is that output? Yeah. Oh. So the 16.441. Oh. Thanks for being with me. Everyone's here. One, two, four, and then one, two. 61.44. Okay. John, this, John. Yeah. Uh, we've got that. Yeah. So, as a part, what's the difference? It's 61.44 or 6400, is like, what's the delta there? What is that? It's some like dust and rocks and not crude actually. Yeah. So, what's this is, gross stuff that you take out to clean your beans? Yeah. Then they go into the roster. Yeah. And let's, let's do this. How many kilograms per glass per roster? 15 kilograms per day. And that's a 1.25. And we, and I'm going to say 1.5 is the way I sit. Now we're, okay. And then how many of those are there? There's just one. What, how many hours per day is it working? Okay. So that gives us one. 4,000, 3,000. 1,000. So, let's do a half of the green. So, let me just, let's do the math to get to 1,000. The 1333 so that, um, people there know this can, how do I, how do I get to 333? Yeah. Cool. Jared? Would you include like partial cycles? Okay. Jared asks a really good like methodological conceptual question. We're only going to do 62% here and we're going to just do base case. Like, what I would do eventually once I get my head around this is add in complexity. But back of the, back of the envelope, calculate right now, I'm just going to be doing this. Great question. Okay. Dr. John, what's the yell on this? I think 100%. Okay, yeah. Some, some nerve out there. I decided to fight you all then. No, no, no. It's a nerve worrying about like when you're roasting it, it's probably like, off-gassing some, some, like, put in the bean and it's probably losing a little bit of a reason to worry about that. We're not going to, we're going to wait for our end of that. Okay, 1990s. Funny, funny fact, chocolate doesn't count as a food or like food safety stuff when it's being like shipped by like a FDA like regulation whatever, because there's no water in it. So it can like technically just keep like for forever bacteria things real. So it's up around two. But even then every six and has access. We can't sit down. We don't work. We do 250 over and down. Okay, says it. We can max out a couple of things. Okay, this is interesting. There's something in Hello, that's a one hour. Now that's actually not true. Now it's hard to like read between the lines here. To be honest, in case that's a couple of challenges. You're ready for problems. No, right. Exactly. I just want to highlight jumping. You can't exactly see in the way it's written. It's just worth working here. The first two steps are true batch processes. So think about when you make like proper chip cookies. You put like 12 of them on a pan. You put it in the oven. And then you know 15 minutes of you pull them out and you got 12 cookies. So if you like like look at it, like squint at it. Maybe like try to document this with a soft watch. You don't get like one cookie every minute or so. What you do is you get 12 cookies every 15 minutes. They come out of the process. These two processes are batch processes. You put them in the roaster. That's the batch process. You put them in the roaster and then an hour and a half later it comes out. The big, the croutons of beans. The winnower is actually a slightly different kind of process. What it can do is it can process 450 kilograms of beans per hour. It could, you can do that that much. And it's more of something that we will see next time. It's more of a continuous process. Crease that. In fact, if you thought about what, like, what happens here is beans just float through like a river of beans. And it'd be hard to think about like what's the croutons time there. It's not like you have to scrape a fags of 250 kilograms for jumping out every hour or so. How do you think about the croutons time if you just have a concept of beans? It's a rate. What do you say when you said that? Like a speed rate? Oh, no. Like what? Like 450 beans in an hour. But it's not. Kilograms for an hour. Or Kilograms for an hour. Right. This is exactly right. But like what would it be a crouton? Like how long it takes to get... No, that's through a good time. Every time. Like, let's do this. Let's do ultra-slomo videos and zoom in. Here's the beans that are flowing like through the thing until like the whole evening. And then ultra-slomo zoom in. Did you like identified croutons there? Maybe. How would it look like? Like... For a bean? Yeah. Like... Yeah, this... Yes. It doesn't make a sense to do that. It's a little bit light. Like what's the crouton time... If you point a garden hose ahead of your flower bed... You're like... What's the crouton there? You're like atoms. Water molecules, or quarks. You got like a vent calculus to get down to a size of zero. Like, can I just put it down for that? And then like... You have to go with the encounter. You have to go with the encounter. Why are you going to be like that? So some processes... It makes a lot less sense to talk about cycle time for a chunk time. And more sense to talk about what our system is like a wink. Which is just a kind of English word. Like, so we're going to talk about kilograms per hour. It doesn't make a sense to talk about... Like, crouton... Like time for crouton to be when it's kind of warm. It's a little bit like a water molecule that it is like a batch. Cool. A little bit of a cycle, but this is going to be a continuous process. And we're going to... Generally talk about those in terms of alpha rates or flow rates rather than the second half. It's not going to be worth our time, but could we do a crouton by doing this of input? Yeah. We're doing a batch going in. Yeah, like the batch go through, like putting maybe a little gap. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, like a hundred weights. What should they do with potatoes? Next time, who read ahead? What units do they use in the grand radius? Oh gosh, I don't know. Bubbles. Bubbles. Barrels. Yeah, barrels. They have actual barrels, the same barriers. But that's like a quantity that they put in. That's a hell of a lot of. Okay, cool. Yeah, I hope. Once you felt it, once you had to stress when you realized, John and Lindsay are you going to go about barrel? That's all they have. Bubbles. What do you know about your life? Actually, that's all I have. What do you know about your life? That's my life. That's your life. That's your life. Okay. What's up? Uh, how did I get it? John, win away. One machine. We have one of those machines. And eight hours per day. So this is, by the way, this is a number of kind of like, in theory we could do if we weren't constrained. Where do we get 250 from? You suppose, John. Well, that's not the average. We're just inheriting the previous step. In reality, theoretically, ideally, could you form 50? I don't know. I feel like we're hour. Probably isn't because it's just inheriting batches of 250 from the previous step. Okay. And so that's not 30, 600. It's what it comes in. 74%. 74% or 74% or 36% or so. That's not 60%. 2664. Really quickly sideline. Who can, who can tell us what's in? Well, what's coming up? So what, what way in? Clean roasted beans. And what comes out? This. This. Where, what happens to the shells? Animal. Animal. You discard it. The answer to sold them is like a crank mulch because it's like a cube of wood. It smells like something. I think that, I think that it's an animal. Animal. Yeah. There's a place here that makes those shells into like some kind of energy drink. You know what I'm talking about? What's a cow? What's a cow? Yeah. And they, it's creal. They really work. Oh, you're under the tree. Oh, I have to. Okay. How do we say this word here? John? No. No, no, no, no. Oh, no. What? I need an accent. I put an accent. You. Okay. John, go ahead. 150 kilograms. 115? No, no, no, no. Okay. 1.25. 1.25? No, no, no, no. More to taste. There's one more. One of them. And they're on. 24 out of it. That's it. 16. They're going in two shifts. Okay. That gives us. Okay. 14. Okay. 14. 100 per second yield. 14.72. Okay. And then onto the couch. Pulse. And then, uh, 14.00 kilograms. Another answer to a quiz question. Are you? Okay. Okay. How long does this take? How long does this take? It's been in the last 40 days. We'll come 15. We have two of us. Two of us. And how long is it? What? 24. Okay. 24 out of the day. This. I exactly think this has a 14.20 to work. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. Yes. That's not working 100 kilograms. It is. Correct. So, uh, 13.44 goes in. And then, like, from another little thing, it has sugar that goes in there. So, 13.42. No. No. No. I'm just waiting. Is that three comin屈? Three pla meeting is are too much, we're out of the competition. Yeah, so clean. Wait, wait, wait. I'll clean the bowl. We are going to be able to count guys. in savory or very soon to do this, to write the output of the adj. Oh, that's a good question. This should be, what is it? I'll just joke another 100% It's like 130 something per second. Thank you. And that's what you would say even other. Yes, this is a really challenging question. I think we're gonna have to solve. I wish we could just forget about it. I'm not sure. Temperature, volume, 130, one, one, I'm just gonna write these up here. I get that this is like, where is this game? I could be wrong here. 14, 89, 14, 89, something like that. And then 19, I got 19, 84, 19. I don't know if this really happened. Okay. Really cool. Do you hear it? Not to see that. I got a little bit of a word. Yeah, I also got it now. Really what? It's 200. I got those numbers. It depends if you use the conservative or the like more then or youound for 60% that's not as easy to use. I'm gonna do what's 22%. Let me look, before we get that本当 Quick Play. It feels like they're just still like a Cindy cold coffee. What? Cindy cold coffee. What? Cindy, you guys are not going to go to the toilet. Just send it. You guys are like Cindy. I'm on it. I'll put it on as well. I'm ready. What's the difference between us? Standing across here, this is what Jim's trying to figure out here, what's the bottom line? What would you say? I mean, what does it look like here is the bottom line? It looks like the roaster. Okay, I agree. Why did you say the roaster? That's our least amount of food per day. Okay, so a bottom line is the step that is the thing that's slowest that's holding it. You can't run faster than the bottom line. I mostly agree, well, I like where Brad's head was, but I don't agree actually. Here's a chance of redemption. You said based on the board. Oh, you're using my words against me. You said it. Some of my closest friends are lawyers. Okay, Brad. Yeah. Look up here. If the roaster is indeed, it's not going to be a little blocked towards it. But if it looks like it is, what would you do to fix the problem when you turn out the roaster is the thing that's constraining it so that you can't make it up? To meet Trader Joe's demand. At a second shift. How do you add a second shift? Bringing more work out. This is like easiest part. Is the easiest capacity increase you can get. You're going to hire another like hippie sociology major from Berkeley. They can just come sit down and do a night shift and just like study while this thing is working. Super. I mean, it's like no brainer to fix that from capacity growth. It's not indeed. This turns out that this is actually not our, like what's wrong with our analysis here, Brad? Let us end here. Yeah. What's wrong? Just because we're not keeping our like the units of what word, looking at the same. Okay, so, so let's look really quickly at what this. Joseph, CC 144 bananas. 61, 40. Listen, this is interesting. The clean beans. Oh, yeah. Okay. What's that? 30 beans. 30 beans, clean beans. What's that? Clean beans. What's that? Roasted clean beans. Yeah. Roasted clean beans and nips. That's that snips. What's missing there? Shell. Shells. And then 1344. Shells with vanilla and sugar. And sugar. So, we actually, the, you know, Brad is terrible at staying here. Okay. We go, get out of here, Brad. It's not a dead end. It's a dead end. It's a dead end. I'm going to stay clean here. It's not a mistake. Like we're trying to get ahead of you on this. We don't have a common, like they load you in it, that goes wrong you see. We'll compare apples to oranges. You don't have apples to eat. Joseph says, open a bag of, uh, kecow beans. Take it kecow bean out. What is it from the very beginning? So what is the constituent of that? We have a shell. Hold on. Is this shell? Okay. That's a metal. It was like shape. And this is like this. Hold on. Hold on. Look at that. Try to be a little clunky. And then we have some mouthwood. Some twigs, a couple of rocks. Anybody here who has a tour down in taste on the university? You haven't done that? Lindsay, you're so... You're a chocolate. I know, because my husband learned it then a bunch of times. He doesn't want to go again. Oh, great. Oh. That's a very solution. Is this before you were married? Yes. To date. It brings that memories. He's the only one still. You just want to make those ones with me though. That's true. Okay. They have this like... They've got a little chocolate factory there. And they've got this little box of shame. Like crazy things that they found on these burlant bags. There's like a screw, you know, like a corn cob. Like all kinds of weird stuff. We come in a big dirty bag. Burlant bag that comes from a farmer in some part of the place. So, we've got shells. Oop. And what's the next thing? Nid. Nid. So, this is the... In fact, if you want to... A little aside, sometimes you and I, these days. And Nid, there's actually two particulates to that. There's the solids. If you look up on a microscope, these are the little dark... Shards of chunks of ground up matter. And there is a cocoa butter. So, when you grind this thing up in a mallejoer, you get this like liquid that comes out of it. It's an oil. You put the flutter. And then you've got the little... Shards of chocolate. If you want to make white chocolate, you just take those solids out. That's the... That's cocoa butter. So, some haters like white chocolate, who doesn't feel chocolate, it's actually not true that cocoa butter is what it makes. That's not the only comment. We're a mistake, that's not true. Okay. Who knew? You don't believe in that? I did not. Thank you. Joe. What's the comment? So that we can do an apple comparison across the whole thing. What is like the least comment denominator? What's the thing that is common through all of these steps? It's a little tricky because we take stuff away and then we start adding it. I know. Yeah, I told you. The thing that comes all the way through is the nips. The nips. Okay. So, this is pretty easy for us to get nips here. Let's do this. Nips. What's the killgams for me? I'm gonna get it here. I'm gonna do six. Oh, this is easy. Oh, you're gonna do six. Oh, yeah. Two, six, six, four. Two, six, six, four. Four can be 72. We said that's 8.33. Okay. What, how much nips are in this 13.33? It's 7.44% of it's nips. Okay. Somebody help us? 96. 96? Okay. Somebody help us with this quick. It's 6.44 nips. 1.252. 4.669. What do you think? That's not the bottom line. Okay. 4.669. Okay. Temperable. Nice. Come on. You said it was easy. I didn't. Oh, maybe that was wrong. Temperable. 39. I'm sorry. Oh, maybe 13.88. Maybe the corp just what you were confused about, what I was messing with. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here's what I was asking. Brad earlier, let us down the Primrose path. Is the conch. We thought it was the Rosa, which wouldn't be a big deal, because all we had to do is what? As shift. Now it looks like what Joseph's going to do. It looks like a healthier Brad, what looks like the actual problem? The conch. The conch. Okay. Now. The cases say this. It's a pretty cool job. What do you some poke on here? Who did you work for before? Is it say? Oh, you did. Yeah. So here's the actual back story. You can kind of squint at this and think of this. First of all, Culberg is not like a local private equity place. It's like the original OG KKR is the OG. Very good place. There was a little kind of fun private investment that Culberg made in Sarcomberer. And he read between the lines, what's going on here is Jim, who's an undergrad in finance. Time of the case, right? He's like in his late 20s. They say, they say it's the fun. There are a bunch of weirdos over there. They're really smart and they have good taste. But that guy's throwing away $30,000 of a conch. When we can't even meet Mark the mayor right now, we need you to go like be the grown up business person at this place. And so Jim gets, and basically imposed on this portfolio company by the private equity investor. And he's got to go and like figure this out. And this is a really fun and interesting job, right? Because he's a finance person. And like day one, he has a call. He's got to go call his old operations professor. Sorry, I didn't make that much attention to class. Remind me what I should do about trying to understand this process. So he gets Excel out and goes into source documents process. And he correctly identifies that the conch is a problem. Yeah. Or that's the constraint. What's the challenge with having the conch be the constraint? That's what's keeping us from making more for trader Joe's for the one row. What's the line? Well, unlike with the roast. With the roast, you just add more hours. It's maxed out. Down? I'm just going to add, isn't it? I'm going to find my reason. That the market process that the quality is really sensitive is how you change that process. This is like, yes, it looks like it's built on this and saved. Number one, that thing is the bottleneck. It's super hard for us to increase capacity because it's one point for us. And then we have two of them. Secondly, it's an important sort of generator of quality in the process. And think about this. If that's the thing that's constrained output global factory and Dr. Steinberg periodically walks by it. So I'll do this. It opens a little spigot, gets a little bit chocolate out of it. It's melted in there. Pulls it out, gets his like friends together. They taste it and he's like, oh, that roast did not go well. That we over roasted those. He goes. And dumps 1,400 kilograms of chocolate down the sewer. Because he's not going to be associated with that. That's it. Now, 14-hour bill grants. 20. Who's our metro people? It's 2,000 pounds. It's 3 pounds. 3 pounds right now. What do we know? What's our team that you are normally associated with? We think you have cars. It's like a whole car. It's like a whole portion of oil. Good old one. Good ones are kind of. It all are in 1979. Of course, now it's in the sea. A whale town. That's like 28. You're dumping that whole thing down the sewer. So not only are you getting rid of the things that you're going to buy, you've tied up your bottleneck step, making stuff that you're going to throw away. So that's super challenging. That's part of what it's been challenging. Okay, so what do you do? We go start looking around for solutions. And the cool solution is what the conch does is what's the final particle size that tells us we need to get down to 25. 25 microns of particle size that they start as what? A thousand, that's, I think, a seven-millimeter. A thousand microns a millimeter. Okay, so what happens is right now, this is going to be, we're going to be a little bit inverse ice here. It takes 50 hours to grind that chocolate from a thousand microns down to this. And if you get it under a microscope and look at 25 micron, and look at if you measure the little particle size of the chocolate, that's when it tastes good. Actually, the particle size determines, is a really important determinant of taste. That takes me to the hours. What does the ball mill do for us? What does it do for us, someone? So it takes, what does it say? It takes 40 to 60 hours to go from 125. But it only takes 12 hours to go from a thousand to 200. Okay, and so we're trying to cut out that segment. 40 to 60 hours to go from 125. We had to do that in class time. That's kind of like the bottleneck, you can say. Yeah, so what does the ball mill do? What does it cost you? So we still need to conscious the air rate and the quality things. We can do the whole process by the milling of 15 hours. It can take the particles from 100 micron. Put the ball in and three hours, right? The ball in two. Okay, so what we can do is use the conscience for this part of the curve. And then we take stuff out and we get it in the ball mill. And it goes down to that. So we save all of that time. If we were really clever, we could build a gantt chart that would do something like this. And we take, let's say a ball, the ball mill, we could do like five hour cycles on it. Is that right? I think that's a good estimate. You can do it and this one just as used to be. Okay. You can't even have this but five seconds to get in the first. So we could take our ball mill and do a little five hour cycles to get the first part of the grain done. Where would we schedule the conscious if we wanted to be like really cool about this? What would you do? Consumption, alternate. Let's say that. We should have that. Brad, redemption. The stack of your basket. The stack. So we could take the stuff out of that cycle, put it into this coach, grind it for ten hours. And then the next cycle comes out of the ball mill. Grind that for ten hours. Brad, whatever you're going to be able to start on the next one we can punch one. We're going to get started right after the conch one, yeah. Right there. It looks like subway tiles. It's almost like, how did that end up so like, this is an interesting question. Yes, Mike? Just in front of you, got the order back. Right, go start and punch, then we go to ball. Yeah, I mean, sorry. Sorry, sorry. That's the ball mill or refurbishment. Yes, you're getting revenge for Brad. Good week, man. So this is going, when we finish here, this is going to here, this is going to here. So I apologize. Okay. We get to see you. It's fine. It's fine. We get to see you. So you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right. Did you read the case before class? Yes, I did. I have to say it more. You said it. Brad. Brad. You didn't want to do it. You said it was Brad. No, you didn't. Okay, you would have heard me. Where did, where, how did we figure out like what, it's a miracle that a ball mill from Holland could end up having that like almost exactly fit those two conscience. Is that pretty amazing? Yeah? Well, it does say that they found a manufacturer that can make it custom. Who figured that out? Jim. Like a finance guy? This is pretty amazing. This is, so like, if you want to be like not stupid. Brad. You, you know. Brad, I know what you have to say. If you want to be not stupid, you buy a machine that's not going to be radically oversized or undersized. You're going to buy something, spend a year getting all like dialed in. You buy the thing that's about the right size. How do you know when you got to go figure it out? You couldn't ask like the Industrial Engineering Center figure it out, you could ask like, well, this is small in a place. He's got to be the one that figures out. That's you guys. Like, you can all do this and excel. So, he goes and buys the right size machine. That's cool. That fixes, that's going to radically increase our daily output capacity. I get it. It's something like. You could, the combined college plus ball bill, it's, it's something like, how do you get it? 41, 66 kilograms per day. That's not our bottom line anymore. Now it's the bottom line. The roadster. The roadster. What did we say? How do we fix the roadster problem? I have to say. What's the next bottom line after that? The belliger. The belliger. Okay. What do we do at that? At a base? I was just curious with the consumable. Are you assuming the problem is out of any 20 hours a day? It's going to be around 24. Still. Yeah, yeah. So we still are scared about that. But we've got lots more to pass it out. Belliger. Okay, so we can go, we build one of those from like, get another one for Easter Germany and rebuild another one. What's our next bottom line after that? We know. Temporal. Temporal. Okay, here's the challenge. Like this is easy to fix. This we can add another shift or buy another machine. This thing is scary. How much does a temperate mold line cost? It's super expensive. Is it big and a great refrigeration thing? It's all bent and stuff. So here's where we switch into like the business challenge. What did I say? We did a dessert. What were you going to ask? What was I going to ask? Yeah. What did I say you were supposed to ask like how do you think of that? Do you remind you to come back from the process? Okay. Okay. Okay. Stir it. Why don't we just go out the source? The temperate mold is somebody else. So I talked to my group about this a lot yesterday. We argued. I think we should. Yeah, why? But if we do that, we'll be changing our product. Our product will be liquid chocolate, not potentially non-traditional. And this may bring some risk to us. It might be worth the risk. Did you think it would worth the risk? I mean, I think we're often doing 35% in house. Yeah. So maybe it's maybe fine. We can continue to do some of that for our factory tour. Yeah. The process a lot of people come to us. They're good. But they don't need to know that. That's susceptible for giving everything out. Do you feel like that's susceptible? Ethics is in a gear. Don't worry about it. This is interesting. So this is kind of where they got you. They got to this, the horns of this particular grunt. Carolyn? I just want to say, like, it even expressed it in the case that the people that the houses to, that should do temperate still. And then that's why they choose. This one sure was saying it was a group. Corporate wine dress, listen to that. It was just me that didn't listen to it. No, and also in certain cases it was extremely expensive. I was also thinking about transport costs. You're adding all these other elements into that. They can afford it. Okay. So here's where the story gets sent. Or happy depending on who you are. This is where Jim got to. They fix everything with a ball mouth. There's a fungal wrinkle with particle size that they have to fix. Turns out the ball mouth looks... Particle size is too precise. And subtle flavor comes from different particle sizes. So they had to figure out a way to open the pit. Yeah, if you take batches out at different times to generate the distribution of particle size. It's kind of very cool. But they got to this dilemma, which is like... We probably are going to have to add a temperate mold slide. If we want to have control of our product and be careful about quality and all that stuff. And that thing is really expensive. So in a company in this size, they're going to investors. They get their own money. They're growing. Like, what do you do? Where do you go get? Next to a million bucks. Like, how are you going to grow this thing? And this is where they decide to go out to their investors. Their owners and say, we're going to either do a capital call for a million bucks to build a new temperate mold line. Or, like, what's an alternative? Exactly. So it turns out that Hershey at this point in time is sniffing around for something to build like halo brands into their portfolio products. Hershey ends up buying the conversation with these guys. Like, hey, we in capital, we really care a lot about the product. Stork says, remind us that we got to pay attention to this. Hershey's like, cool. We're not going to industrialize this process. You guys can be who you are. We just want you for the brand to put into our portfolio. You can use our distribution channels. We're not going to change your process. That's really cool. The product is so that they sell for, like, the time like I store it multiple. I don't remember what it is. It's a huge exit for Colbert, again, Charles Berger and Simon Berger. They sell it for a ton of money. Hershey comes in and helps them buy a new temperate mold line. Like they have to use the one that they can just give them, like, that. So I know these things. Three years in, what do you be tempted to do if you're Hershey? And you find out that this is a super expensive stupid process. Off to my industry. I have seen it. I have seen it. Well, happy nuts. Yeah. So this is not another nut. This is not another nut. I'm going to Hershey. Think about their, if I may, James, there are only so many people in the world that want to buy a $350,000 horse and a lover. Most of the residents want to buy a corolla or a Prius or whatever. Right? So they realize this is super expensive. It's super slow. Sourcing for Venezuela is a huge pain. We could probably bring sound there sourcing in house to Hershey's because we have buying power. We can go by beans in place. We can actually probably put these three halo brands all in the same manufacturing plant in Indiana together. And so they do that. What do they have to do with the sharpener? Lindsay says, last time, this is very hurtful. What did you say about the quality of the sharpener? It's so bad. So bad. Why? I'm not the taste and the texture. It was tasty. They had actually changed the process. So it was the same product. So this is a really interesting case because to me, you've got some layers of what's going on in business. What's going on in investment, sort of level. And you also have this kind of sad happy story. A couple people got rich based on their really cool insight about what happens with the market. But the market's not big enough for something like this to actually go and make it in a sustainable way. Make super expensive ten dollar chocolate bars. Like I had to go to Harman's and poke around in their fancy chocolate section to get those. Those are ten bucks a piece. The sharpener is like $2.99, right? Like just doesn't like that enough. Yeah, I don't know. They're not as expensive. Okay. No. So you can go through all this process. Yeah. So we're looking at a lot of interesting demand. We've already had a lot of interesting demand. What point do you just look into? Should we just open another factor? Because the fact that we have so many bottlenecks on our B. But it just be cheaper and easier to open a second factor. It probably wouldn't. And what I'd say is that the big version of sugar is by another temperable line. It's like, yeah, we've done another factor in double our capacity. But that's going to require some investment. And the particular owners of this business, they didn't have cases for putting one on the diagram. They just wanted to put one on the diagram. So it's a sad happy case. It's awesome. Next time, what are we doing? Let's see. And very. Grand Bury. You guys are welcome. Good job."
