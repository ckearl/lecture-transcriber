  "text": "I'm going to do one of these questions right on the day. I'm going to get better at this. It's all good. I don't want to spend like a ton of time to have a beginning. I thought maybe I could try to improve the feeling of the room. I'm going to have a good quiz like this. It feels predatory. It's poison. It's gone. And I want to share with you a couple of slides that I shared at a fireside that we had on Sunday in our Wednesday in the YSA State Boxer. Here's the context. We're all in fact with the last time, but this is terrible event happening. You've been here last week. Here's the text I got to you later from my daughter Grace, the senior here. Dad, what's your super rational opinion of what's happening to the country and how there's been these things? She's like basically, it feels like the world's ending, everything's falling apart, like our will had it to do. And I stood on that a lot and thought that's probably a bunch of the members in our state were feeling. And so this was the night before, like 7 am, the electricity. And this is what, like, right all around my head was questioned. Because anyway, this fireside going. And this was my answer to Grace. There's a couple of parts I said. Some of it, I won't include here, but here's my answer. Okay. Some data. I'm a nerd. And then there's some of them demonstrating missions because the audience there. Okay. It feels like everything's bad news, but actually doing the real data. The world is actually pretty awesome. And here's some of my data. This is a graph of climate in the United States in 1990. I don't think anybody who reported this is likely a reason for me. The violent climate is falling in half. It's in half. Like, we're safe for today, then we were very good. This is grim. Yes, we have assassinations going on. This is always happening. And that's not like to make anybody feel better about this. But it's a safe. It's not like this is like new. Like, we had these kinds of troubles in the past. And this is there always been crazy people do the bad things. And that hasn't changed much. This is globally annual average deaths caused by natural disasters in the world. So multiplied by thousand back the early century ago. 800,000 people a year, 400,000 people are dying natural causes today. Or natural disasters today. It's a kind of fraction of that. Homicide rates in Western Europe. It turns out, you know, living in Italy in the Middle Ages was not that great. The food was probably pretty good. People were going to watch people painting cool stuff. But the homosapering was like two orders of magnitude higher than it is today. And your impression from watching the news is that all kinds of bad terrible things are wrong. But this is like, we're safer today than we've ever had been. That you chose just Western Europe makes me think the stats weren't good. No, absolutely not. That one is particularly wrong. And that one is, you know, I think, because I think what people tend to think is the world is worse off than it's ever been. And in the context like we're about to end because it's so terrible. And actually, there was a lot worse. There are places where the homosapering is higher. But the world's getting sick. Death, you're likely to be globally death rate from wars per 100,000. You're likely to have died in a war. Yes, we get lives along the way. This war worked to be a numb. This is a... No, the minis. You go slow. It might have been like Yugoslavia, but it might have been some stuff in South China and Africa. And then you've got, we've had lives global war on terror. But like, you're safer now than you've ever been in terms of like dying in a war. Globally, childhood deaths from infection diseases is just a right direction. And this isn't like 100 years. This is the last 30, 20 years. Respirate infections, better heal diseases, malaria, and measles. HIV, you know, and malaria at bumps. But the world's safer, better for people today. Global average life expectancy continues up. And there are books for war and natural disasters, but you've got... If you go back to like 1900 in the US, the global... The average life expectancy of a male in the US in 1900 was like 51 years. It was your average lifespan. Today, it's like... We don't even retire until we're 65. So people weren't even living to retire in age 100 years ago. This is for your remarkable to me. Since 1990, the share of the global population living in the extreme poverty has gone from 40 years to 40 to 10 percent. Down to under 10 percent. Under 10 percent of people globally live in extreme poverty today. That's because of some really cool stuff that people have been doing with technology and economic development and some other projects. This is pretty remarkable. The fourth of the people that we're living in extreme poverty now are... And it's not just like... This is pretty cool. Grace was particularly heartened by this because I think she just lives in fear of stuff. There are some fewer nuclear weapons around today than they were during the Cold War. We got rid of a lot of them over time. It's pretty cool. This... It's been a hundred years ago. People were spending 11 and a half hour in Marie in the North. This probably was largely falling on women doing this 11 and a half hours per week on tree. Today, it's 1 and a half hours per week. Pretty cool. And it's not just about people. Oh no, it's about people. Global literacy. You have to try hard to find a place where literacy is below like 85 percent. There are countries that have made huge progress in the last few years. But more people can read and are literate now than ever had been. And it's pretty dang good. This is what I'm just going to think. See, turtles run the upswing. We've done it in your childhood. Yeah, we've got some climate change. Other things going on. But there's a bunch of stuff that we're doing really well at. It's like poisoning the environment and watching out for species that are... Then this is a fire saying we talked about population of the church is drawing. A number of temples dedicated. A number of works of branches. All of that. And then we ended up talking about being peacemakers. And the word of God that the message of the Savior is a thing that actually helps improve the world. You're feeling like stuff is going to help. There's nothing better than you can do. The script is to us to give people a message of peace from the Savior. So that's my way of life. We're heading to a dark time of the year. Literally the days are getting shorter. And we're living in a news environment where it feels like everything's falling apart. But I just want to say, we're actually living in a better world than we've ever lived in. And there's a bunch to be optimistic about. So, yes, Anne. Can you send that to us? Yeah. Yeah. You got it. Thanks, Brad. All right. Let us now talk about friendship letters. We always talk about 36 letter messages. No. That was like a heavy day. And I was, thanks for noticing. And I'm too excited for it. I'm too excited. I'm going to talk about it. Did anybody hear a little obsessive message even when the box was cleaned out? Yeah. On the other side of the channel. We should have said something like I'm falling. I'm just going to be honest with you. Well, I just like to talk about it. I like, it's like, I don't know what you're saying. I just like to talk about it. It's like, I don't know what you're saying. I just like to talk about it. Well, there's two definitions of unwritten text. There's what shows up on your home screen? Because some of them are like junk ones. You can't talk about it. I'm hard on going to find them with the theme. And there's like what's in that thing. There's a bunch of couples who fix this. This morning, I have a group of, what's in their clothes? Why did they just call me that? Why did they call me that? What? Oh. No, we're not going to have to do more. I'm going to be having a conversation with them. I'll see. There's nothing, that's not the reason. It's not bigger. All right. We talked about, there was some discussion over here about how the rents is company. Who are our rents speaker here? Izzy. Izzy. Is he having to say a new place? I think we're just asking for the money. Huh? We don't think it's okay. Is there a full of that? I'm full of that. Sure, how do you know that? It's a rash to you. And it goes back around. In Boulder, I said, we should put it down on the floor. I don't think it's okay. I don't think it's okay. All right, fine. We're doing it. Don't. What was he going to say again? I would say, for traditions, we're doing it in a nodule. But in French, friends, don't think it's okay. Ah. He's still my heart, it's amazing. Sorry. Sorry. That's not exciting. We're just... Yeah. I'm so sorry. Okay. That's a good thing. It's the end of it. Do you know? I don't have to do that. Take a picture. So here, if I were... Well, no, take a picture. Tell us about it right now. So it's a fragment factory of Nenefri. And the main producer of the poetry. Okay. And she dressed... And she does need work. And... Okay. What, what, what, so... We're... We're gonna focus on children's need work today. But, uh, they do a bunch of stuff. Uh... Let's see. Yeah, keep going. Yeah, so they're experimented with that particular line. We're ready to sell, sell your manufacturing layer. Go on. What else? That's a big picture right now. Okay, so... The... The... The company that is advantage is that quality. Because they have high skills workers. And... Another company that is advantage is the... The service for their... They would pay the price. Okay, cool. What is customer service being in that setting? You think we don't? They're able to repair the service by... Like half-day battery back with that. Nice. So if, uh... What's that store? No, it's a store for you. Sacks. Sacks, just find it in the way you can. Okay, but the sacks work is what you do. It's socks. Good customer service in that situation means... They're going to get socks that they need on time. High quality, whatever. Cool. Okay, Janelle, who works at this place? Uh... Like that name? No. How is your name? John Luke. As well? Sure. Well, now... Like, how do you describe the workforce? The workforce of high quality workers. They have also supervisors. Okay. How do we pay the people? Do you remember this? If you can send it, I'll go. Yeah. We call this... Peace, right? Peace, right? Peace, right? Uh... Peace, right? Peace, right? Peace, right? Peace, right? Peace, right? Peace, right. What do... What do... Peace, right means? Somebody help us out. I'll tell you. Okay, okay. So, it's a... You mean maybe I units. Yeah. What was it? Did we do a case of one time ago with your... Did you remember that? Something about a frame? Something about my ring. That's a thing. The last time we did it. So, maybe you look Peace, right? Um... I'm just maybe not a fair question, because it's not in the case necessarily, but like... What's the nature of the employment relationship in France? Like, we do our adoring there, and there are some other workers. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. Um... The nature of the relationship? Yeah. They... They are working because they want me. They want to get paid. How does... How does your adoring treat their workers? Oh, yeah. And they have a good health. They have what? A good... They have a lot of benefits, I believe. Yeah. And... Did you train them? And they what? Train. Training, yeah. Good. What... But the case of school, they're like, how we feel about our workers. They feel that the workers are the remain assets. They think that... Okay, this is awesome. Yeah. Almost like we will, close to each other. We've got hundreds of years working here. This is like, almost like family. Okay, is that cool? Okay, what else is not good? But these workers. So they... Yeah, training them like family, they have expectations being the work all year long. Like they're legally contracted. It's an employee that's being called. But, no, it doesn't make sense to me. What do you mean? Like they have an agreement. I think it's contractually in like, on the right to employ them throughout the year. Okay. Yeah, this is an unfair question for me to ask Carolyn. But I'm going to just... Like you got experience in a European place that maybe is a little bit more like France. It is than the US's. What's the nature of the employment, like, relationship in Sweden? In Sweden, I can also talk about friends. Okay. Well, like usually in general, you had rights. There's a second. Did she have a second? No, no. What do you mean by that? You're not going to be able to do that again. Your company has rights? No, it's like as an employee, you have expectations and rights that are put on the company. The companies that need to provide certain benefits to the employee. The employers. And then, wait, you're looking for something specific. No, no, no, it's not really good. I'm just confused. Like, what do you want to do? You want to fire somebody to get a friend. But then there's certain legalities. For example, we talked about that previously in leadership that, for example, if you hire people, you cannot just fire them however you want. Why not? Because of legalities. Usually, for example, there are five people that come into a company. You kind of fire people according to seniority. Have you been in a company for 10 years? You can't just fire them, even though they've done something bad. It's the first one that... The last one that came in, it's like, lost in her status. I don't like that. So, this is not exactly correct, but, directly, I'm going to call this almost like lifetime employment. Like, once you hire someone, you're stuck with them. And I, you know, I generally don't like to go to nice places. Does anybody ever went to like, for answer, really, or Spain in like, August? What's going on there in August? It's fine, nobody wears. Where are they? At the beach. At the beach. The spa. Who's paying for that? What? So, Jen? Jen, where are you going to sit? No, I'm just thinking. I'm like, why am I not looking? I know. You're like, he's like global surveys are like, everybody in Finland is happy. What are you doing in Germany? Like, a lot of this dark like half the year, like, how do they be happy? This is probably part of it. Carolyn? Oh, yeah. I just think it's interesting to say that they're loyal to the company, because in general, especially in France, they have that mentality where it's like, they're not content, they're going to, you know, bone strides, the bus system, and the train system, and they're work. This is like, is that the mission that it was last week? Yeah, and the general, is that, like, in fact, like, okay, we'll talk about it maybe later in this case, but like, the woman, she's going on maternity leave, and she chooses to come back early, because she had that camaraderie with her team. That's amazing. Okay, so back in general, we've got this workforce that we, they're trained, they're skilled, we can't fire them. They actually like, I'm going to work, like, this is kind of interesting in the way. Okay. Anything else to add to our background? Let me ask, of course, look. What do we do? The case mentioned something about, like, overproduction or something. Remember this? Yeah. What's that thing? What's overproduction? So, and these are notes, and they're not able to see that only the type of main or the group did that. Why? There's just a certain number of people in France, why I get it in print. Because they're productionists a year before. And so, that we build, like, steam made up, and they take up what's like, steam made up at the end of the day, is the grant for their reality. And what happens to this stuff that we, so we produce, what do the sex think of us? They're mad at us. If we overproduce what happens to the clothes that we overproduce, general. We have to do, like, half-saints, and... 20%. And it also looks that perfect market. So, 20% of production, so if we put someone's sale, we rebrand it. This is bad for profitability. Do you all run a phase? Some of you are at a phase of life, where you buy sometimes clothes that are these 20% enough at. Where those end up? Well, CJ Max. That's right. What's the best score somebody's got? Like, CJ Max. Carlos? I got a baby, a few of us tied for five-year-old clothes. What brand was it? I was a diamond brand. I don't know what that meant. So, some Italian manufacturer isn't happy in the end. No, yeah, exactly. Think about this. And predict a man like a year of new advance getting the tie. A bunch of fashionable Italians gone. I want that one. And then they got some less fashionable visitors. Some people. There's a four graduate student at the end. Where is this tie? Why can't I run a rep from their brand? These are flip-around people. You can see the tag. You'd be like, Ferragamo. Where are you? Not really. What's another good score? You may have a nice annual drop. Yeah. Yeah, just come on baby, go for $15. $15? That's cool. Super $20. What kind? English rock-born. Nice. Wow. Doesn't it hurt the brand? It probably does. I saw your picture in your bio. You wanted that beer? That beer? Oh, why are we doing this stuff? Yeah. I had full man-bottom pick beer. Where in that drop wanted to? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I found lots. I used to flip stuff from Teagueir back to the very college. You're like a bottom feeder in the economy? I go a posh mark. Did you have 30-day return policies? So if you didn't sell them posh mark, then 30 gates are taken back in my money back. And just keep going. I'm going to buy some money. I'm going to buy some money for the whole day. I'm going to get lost. What's up, baby? This is our background. This is where we are today. For the first, for most of the class, we're not going to talk about the cell. We're going to talk about the cells at the end. In order to get our heads around what the cells are going to do for us, we're going to focus on children's knitwear sewing before we do the cell-knit. So we're going to go back and describe the process as it was before. And with the exhibit, what's the exhibit has this like test board look? Seven. So there are a couple... Seven. Okay, so... What is in this look? This, uh, the seven has this thing. It looks like this. I can draw all of them. I can draw a lot of them. Okay. What's going on? That's a fun, very question. We're going to take a kit of children's sweaters, all the cut pieces that have come in from the previous step. And we're going to go into the sewing area. And Lindsay, the case has some stuff like this. I think is there any there? Yeah. And there's a be here, be here, the convener. I don't know. That's nice. No, the details are better that way. Okay, we're over there. Okay, so Lindsay, we get this kit of clothes. How many sweaters, like parts, we have these parts for sweaters. How many sweaters are in one of these bins? There's a thing. I want to say 100, but I don't know. There's only quiz. Two hundred. Two hundred. Okay. So, how many got my stuff? Two hundred. Two hundred. Okay. Lindsay, 200 of these sweaters are in a bin. And they go into station A here. And then they got to get station B. And then they fight past some of those. They go to station C. And then let's say they go to D. And then they go down to this. Whatever they are. Like, we, this bin takes what looks to me like a random hat through the factory. What did they take that? Like, how does it, here's the question. How does the bin get to this B rather than this B for this? I just thought that was a supervisor decision. Supervisors are also the material handling people. They got these bins on wheels of 200. Zack is A. These three gentlemen here are B. Okay, Lindsay. I got, you want me to be three, which one do I take it to? Whichever one I like the most. Yeah, pretty much. I think Val had that would be. Okay. I think we all know who I am. Please stay with kids. They're all. It's their problem. Maybe that's why I have to be optimistic about the slideshow. Okay. Lindsay, how do I decide between my three favorite Bs here? What are you supposed? I'm not really in the case that's maybe kind of is. How are you excited? Honestly, who has at least worked lined up? Who has at least worked like that? How do I know? Look in their bins. Look in their bins. Jorge has at least the mouth. Cool. Cool. And so are we cool with this? Yeah. Alright. Well, we also need to be dependent on the size of the different batch sizes. It's a good thing they don't have to. It's a good thing. Like, well, yeah, yes, like when you have a vascular one here producing these two under the hood. Yeah. Or there's a play. I might have to be semaphob because I sell or triple or so, but please do not. So I think, yeah. You know, they solve the evasion from like, so, so, sorry about it. No, no, no. But I would take a look where the sweet children are pretty sweet. So, what's really interesting about this system that we've just described is that it may be before he works faster than other people, so I've been stopped here. Or it could be that he's working out a less popular skew. But whatever the case, I've got this, it looks like a pretty like dumb system. There's no like big LCD screen with, you know, our MRP system going on here. It's literally just two who looks like they've got the most capacity. So it could be a combination of how to actually work on that and the modular. I have a question, though, because it mentioned that there is a round in slip for every year. Yes. Would it, like, all ready have a specific, like, the two or a key? Corbin is shaking his head at you. No, because it's just a process that matters. It doesn't matter where it goes. So it says it needs step B. It doesn't say which B we go to. Yeah. And then you be step, you know, D, and then there's no C because that's others. Because that's just for collars. And there's no collar on this particular sweater, and I could take a screen to you or to defenate what it is. Cool? Okay. It's kind of the recipe, but we don't really care which of the workers is the trend in the journey. Okay. Lindsay. What? Let's calculate our labor utilization. How do we do? Do you remember generically what utilization is? It's the available time to add it back. You said your actual time to add it back to your total time? Time. Just use. Over what? Time available. Time available. And this is going to be a little... This is going to be for people from machines. Okay. How would we calculate our... Actually, that's not... Let's have to play. There's a... Now let's see. That's exactly what we're doing. What? How do we do labor? Keep the number. We're... Hours work in the day. Okay. This is... Right. Well, I guess. Let's do... Time available to me. So this is a... Eight hours per day. Thanks. What? 42 workers. What? 42 workers. Oh, cool. 42 workers. And... What's that? Five. Yeah, five days a week. I'm going to... Let's do this again. Let's... How many... Let's get it in terms of minutes. Okay. Then 60. 60 minutes per day. That's going to give us what? Somebody can take the... What is it? For hours. Thank you. For hours. So many... We've got to get it for us. For... For... For... 20,000... Okay. Now... This is bananas? It is for... There's 20,000 minutes in an age? Because I'm... Working as... Oh, this... Let's go this... For... For... Minutes... Her day. That cool? Cool. Let's hear you cool with that? Yep. That's our time available. If you think about this, it's like abstractly... Of this like... Bank account of minutes we can use. That's what's available to us in the factory. Lindsay, how would we figure out how many are actually being used? I mean, I'm sure I'm watching them. I said, sure I'm watching them? Yeah, well, that's good. We actually have some empirical data to tell us how... How do we... John, how have we seen this? Well... It's such that others never think of something. Okay, Lindsay, don't... Yes. Don't let me... Okay. Okay. John just said... For every little article, in the factory, there's 10 minutes of labor in it. This thing has 10 minutes of labor. It's hard to see. But there's like... If you were able to like track this shirt all the way through, it's getting 10 minutes... labor per garment. It's getting added to this thing. Okay? Then what? Number of products produced. How many are producing for it? Thank you for looking at this thing. So tell us more on the right thing, Adelaide. 2000 and... Where did you see it? Beginning of page 4. Beginning of page 4. Let's see this. Where is it? Okay, 2000's children's garments. Okay, we're making 2000's of this today. 10 times... 2000... Jordan's... It's really close. Or a day... Lindsay, I'm gonna take this one. Oh, please. 20,000. Hey! That's really good. Somebody can calculate her. That was what that... Lindsay, you focus on the qualitative aspect of this. Somebody actually do the calculation. 99. And I'm going... This one? And I'm going to... So, Lindsay, this is 99.2% labor utilization. What does that look like? We're constantly working through the day. Okay. Does that seem consistent or not consistent with what we've said... What GMLS said about... of this place? Yes. Why? I mean, they're motivated to be at work. Okay. They have a good relationship, so... Okay. I'm gonna read that. I'm gonna read that. I'm gonna read that. I'm gonna read that. Why are you stressed about this? It seems very high. Yeah, I mean, first off, I just think it was very high. And if you're worried about the loyalty and the benefits... Trying to wear them out. Yeah. And I mean, they're already taking them on dock, so... Yeah. Trying to get that. Yeah. Yeah, that's on this. Burn out? I think 99.2%. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A big part of low-end, you have this much labor utilization... Means that you don't have downtime, which means that people always have work. But then, people always have work for that long. And these guys are going to have a large amount of lip sitting around. Which is something that we've also seen. Why are we able to have a good thing about it? Because if people constantly have work, so essentially if we have... Okay, let's say that it takes him one minute for his job. And so he's got 200 items in a single batch. And it's been in each that's three and a half hours almost. Yeah. For just a single batch. And how long that we have this lip and everything. Yeah. That's the way we have it. They probably have up to two or three or four batches sitting at their sewing machine at any given moment. James. This is a weird question. Try to integrate what we just heard with what Carolyn said about the nature of the employment relationship in France or Sweden. With the Whip or with the High Labor... With the High Labor utilization. But Whip is going to be actually an expression of the same thing. Like, let's assume for a second that this isn't totally out to lunch. Like that's a directionally correct number with very, very high labor utilization. I'm going to reconcile that with what Carolyn said. Well, they have benefits, but they're also... I mean, I think the incentives align with their... That sounds fancy business because I don't understand anything. So there's eight to do more pieces of work. Why would we do... Why would we set up our incentive structure that way? Because we want more pieces of work, don't we? Okay. Good. Why? Well, we can't do more than the market demands. Right. Well, thank you. We did see you. Okay, fairly. I guess, yeah, I mean, maybe I'm not understanding the question. No, it's a weirdly asked question. Yeah. Well, I was going to say... I'll say something. So, sorry. I don't know how much is 6,800 francs per month means at that time. It's enough to afford cheese at wine and other types. What a bitch. I mean, I'm trying to work in China and then you do whatever your employer tells you to do. He tells you you do this amount of work, you do it. But I don't know, Caroline's like... You said they have rights over there. If they're getting like, hey, you have to use 99.2% of time. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So I'm going to add... I totally like this. Let me just say, Bill, why would we structure it so that people are working 99% of the time? If we own this company, why would we structure it that way? I mean, obviously we want to get higher profitability. But in the context of what Caroline said, why would we structure it this way, Dallin? Because we can't fire them. So we have to... Derek just like, that's what I was going to say. It could just sit there and do nothing. And I mean, do a little bit. We're stuck with them, Dallin. Right, you're stuck with them. So they're not intrinsically or extrinsically motivated to walk and speak to intrinsically, actually. But they're not extrinsically or externally motivated to work unless there's some sort of incentive. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I get this. And you don't even have to go that far. You can just say, adjusting the size of the labor pool here to meet market demand is essentially impossible. You can dial it down. You could go sit around if you want. But if we've got super expensive people with super expensive benefits that we're stuck with for life. And by the way, that's the dim version. The nice version is, we lift close to them and we're family kind of. Like, we got to keep them working. Let's calculate one other thing really quickly. Yes, Jen? There is a part in the case that talks about how they had to adjust for the distribution of demand. And they had to hire some people. Does those people fall into this? It's going to be a special attempt. Carol, there's going to be a special attempt to kind of avoid relationships. Okay. Really quickly, let's calculate machine utilization. So machine utilization time use over time available. Even having a quick back of the envelope way to calculate machine utilization. Time use over time available. There's complicated ways to do this and easy way to do this. So you guys see a really quick easy way to do this? Just do like the machines that you use to add arms to them. Yeah. And they are available to you for arms today. Okay. Keep going. So there are machines that you utilize to 30% since you're not right. Okay. So for this, our permits is here. Let's assume that the machines are only available in eight hours per day because the worker has to be there to use it. It's not over there. Keep going. So take that out. Okay, so that's my priority. Take the point where it's making eight hours a day that's available. What's the time use? Well, I'd be... Wouldn't it just be the same as the... Yeah, we're missing one little identity there. What's the little identity we're missing out? There's more machines in the team. Okay. How many machines are there? So that's available. So this is workers. Machines. Or 55 for available. And this is a little bit of an assumption. It's a lot of assumption. How many workers do we have available for those machines Jacob? 42. 42. So this is... Again, we're assuming that every machine... You can have one person on a machine and a lot of life. But roughly speaking, our machine utilization is going to be something like what? 76.4%. 76.4%. Okay. Really quickly. Uh... James. We're going to build what we call the Mason ratio. Ready? It's your moment of the... It's your moment of the sector. Uh... Let's do machine utilization. It's over labor utilization. Is that a ratio? And this is 76 over 99.2. This is... I don't know if my math write less than 1. Cool? You see this? So we're basically... This is an articulation that we're using... People more than we are using machines here. Flip this. And... I used to be really judgmental when I would go fly on a plane. I'd be sitting in the plane. If we get stuck by the window, look out on the tarmac and we're sitting there waiting to take off. And look at the workers out there, like farting around. They're like, you know, texting, talking to their friends, and I'm like, you know, playing... You know, I throw this through case. And... It's exactly sit right. Look at your luggage. But I also noticed with airlines they're really serious about trying to like keep the planes loaded up. I mean, it's rare down in playing these days without it being a pretty cold time. So they try to keep them loaded up. They're trying to turn them around really quick. You can see the stress when the plane comes in. They're trying to get it so they can get it to take off on a time. My... My rough read of this situation is that like an airline tries to have really big machine utilization and the worker utilization is like me. Or what I saw. And you'd see the same thing if you went to TSMC where they're making chips. You see a bunch of people in like clean room suits, stand around looking at like a $200 billion dollar a liner that makes you pure chips. And they're just like... kind of like you're... It looks like they're using the machine they're making sure that the machine utilization pack is high and the worker utilization is low. That's... Is that because the machine's 10 to be more expensive? Or is that because... I don't know. Okay. This is a Mason equation. What do you say, James? Like, let's assume everybody is good here. They'll have their hearts on the right place and they're trying to be profitable. Why would it be like equal to them? It would be rational when airlines run a Mason ratio high. And for... Do I do it right to run a Mason ratio lower than one? Probably. Well, airlines have planes are expensive. There's what page says. Yeah, fly people. But I would say in do I do it like the expensive part of the operation is the work force. It's up with the skilled workforce. And so machines are giving out as expensive. And so you want to have more... Like you want to have more machine capacity than people. You're not saying that people are worth less in some cosmic way. It's just like the dollars... Yeah, how much is possible to... Okay, pay to what would you add to that? Yeah, I think he said depending on the industry, right? How much it takes to maybe fix an airline or if things run first is... If one of the sewing machines were one, we have other sewing machines to use. But that's an articulation of our strategy. If we were saying that we're being rational, I may agree with you, it's not like we're... God gave us 55 machines. We made a decision to have those 55 machines. But it's cheaper to fix a machine than to have workers waiting for a machine there on machine fix. Why? Because the workers cost more annually. Yeah, Carolyn. Yeah. That was a good fight you were calling. No, no, can't you just... You're representing that. You're representing that. This is really interesting. Now, I'm not joking calling this the makes... I don't think that there's a name for this ratio. Kind of made it up. It's made it up. I've never heard of it. It'll be okay. But this is a really interesting way to sort of think about resource allocation. And looking at different kinds of operations. Some... Any any countings in here? Okay. And where are the rules around depreciate? Like, delta buys a jet from Airbus or Boeing. Or the rules around depreciation on that. Well, you can... There's like certain kind, but usually it's just straight line depreciation. For how many years? That would probably over like 20 or 30. Do you get to... Do you do depreciation when the plane is full? It doesn't matter. But like when it's a night, when it's just sitting there, no passengers in it. Don't you get like a break? I mean, it's just the same no matter what. If they're using them or not. That's terrible. You do get... Do you see this? It's like, how... It's the worst. So... You're paying for the plane regardless of whether it's being used. So there's this really strong incentive to load that thing up. That's why you're willing to put people on their... In the cheap seats in the back. Because it's at least helping with over-adms or a generator, probably helping pay for gas. Right? And having an empty plane is super expensive. That's why it's pre-rational for delta to pay some people... To tend to that expensive asset. And maybe be a little bit less highly utilized during part of the day. They're not being lazy. Delta is not being lazy. That's an articulation of how much those people cost for some of the plane costs. It's flipped with Doridora because the people are the... They're like the jet here. They're the expensive thing. And the sewing machines... You can like sell a used sewing machine on eBay and then buy another one on eBay. There's like user equipment companies for this stuff. That's not the expensive thing. The expensive thing is a Frenchie. Look at that, I can't fire. And that has like really great work like balance knowledge. James? A lot of times in that wire line has paid their workers differently too. Like there is a lot of stuff only paid for flight time. Even other ones have changed between flights. And so there's inside of my eyes and then... So you're trying to... Yeah, this... Yeah, totally. In the air and fly. Yep. I love it. Okay. That's cool. So now we've kind of got our like heads around what this place kind of feels like. I want to... Diego. You know what I mean? You guys don't know this but Diego is a dream job. He's to go fix the operations at Doritoy. So, Diego, there are graduates from here. And interviews that are consulting place. And the first client engaged with Diego and did put him on. He's to go to Doritoy. And help them and fix, by the way, uh... Chinella. What was the... There was one little thing we missed here. What was their perspective on like their inventory? Do you remember? We said that they overproduced... There was another kind of little quality in the case of my little about inventory. It's okay. What's their... Peter, what are they doing in inventory? They have lots of inventory. Okay. That's... That's a lot of inventory. Okay. So, Diego gets a job going over to Doritoy and they're going to... We need to understand how much inventory we have. Amidst you ever doing inventory accounts? I did. He did. Oh! Fun. What is it inventory accounts involved? I mean, personally, purpose of it is making sure whatever you say on the books tied to wherever on the store house. They're keeping everybody on it. Yeah. But like, what are you actually... So, what do you actually have to do in a inventory account? So, we'll be sure that we were like decide, like... We don't need to choose 20. Who saw that? Who did we work with? Who saw that inventory? Well, I already had to be there and look at it. But, what do you mean by who saw it? Like, how did you count the inventory? Oh, I basically looked at it and went by like, wait, you had to go out? Oh, hey! And like, into the warehouse. Yeah, you know what I'm counting to breathe? Yeah, it's part of your job. You guys... You literally go to the warehouse in the factory and count? Yeah, to do. Yeah. With a worker, you know, like... And then we have like a cat. Do you work at a warehouse? Depends on the industry... I had not, but some people do. Depends on what it looked at. This has to be a dream job. It does. Right, I mean done, maybe. What? They say that being... I mean done. Any internet? No, sometimes this is like... You see, the ass, you're going... He's like... He's like... He's like... I mean, first, that can do it. That's it. Good. Okay. So, you got a counting inventory... Overcriscence. Like that? Usually at the end of the year, overcriscence. Yeah. That's a warning. Okay. So, you got this inventory thing. Like, Diego, his job is to go like one of the inventory first down. Figure out what the operation is. So, why is that the children that were sewing factory... This one? And he's going to count the inventory. Before we count the inventory, I want to get a couple of numbers up here. This was all the... A quiz we did a while ago. What was the two-foot time in the week? Three weeks. Yes. Okay. Two weeks of working hours today. Okay. Nice. Yeah. Just two weeks. Take it out with the junk. So, you're going to need to talk to me about glass cans. Yeah. You think you got a box? Yeah. I was looking really... He wasn't prepared. Is that a thing? Yeah. Yes, a different thing. I know. Okay. So, I don't know how many days of the... 50 days of the... What? The college-foot-time. Yeah. And then, Diego, do you remember the output rate? How many garments are we making for today? Two thousand. Today, so this is two thousand units per day. Okay. Now, we got that. I just want to make sure that we have a little more. Yeah, go. Watch it. And they say, Diego, we need you to count for the jewelry. We do this in a funny way because it's France. We don't have to go look at all the little boxes. What we want you to do is go walk through some like stairs or one of the side of the faculty. They go up the inside of the factory. There's that catwalk that goes across. So, you go walk it there, put it on the hard hat. Walk across the catwalk. And then, bring your phone with you. And then, lean out safely. Hold it there thing. Do your thing. Zoom out. And take a coach. And take a picture of the whole factory floor. Cool. And then, count of all of the sweaters in the CFS area on the floor. Go back to your desk. I'm like, you're dropped this to your computer. And then, count both of the sweaters. That is, I mean, an account that might be equivalent with the details of this. But fundamentally, that's what the process in the jewelry is. It's a snapshot at a moment in time of how much money isn't out of count. And the sweaters are in that account. Counts, you guys have put that? Okay. Diego, got it? Yeah. Diego, though, is super smart. And he says, I think there's a way for me to actually figure this out mathematically, rather than having to be able to do that stupid stuff that we came up with. So, given that it takes us 15, everybody else, zip up your lips. Don't say, if you see this quickly, don't say this out loud. Diego's our test subject here. Here's my question. Could you figure out mathematically how much, how many sweaters are out there on the floor at any given time, given these two numbers? Knowing that it takes us 15 minutes or 15 days to get through the factory, we're trying out 2,000 per day. How many sweaters use the suspector actually out on the floor at any given time? You're thinking logically, you're thinking, then what's the implication of this fight? Okay. Diego says, think about this. Every day, we're putting out 2,000, which means every day, we're bringing in enough stuff to make 2,000 sweaters. So, 2,000, 2,000. And they're really moving that in, and then it takes 15 days to mark through the plan. And then it comes out. So, Diego says 15 times 2,000 equals his estimate is that there's 30,000 sweaters out there on the floor. But maybe you've got thinking the labor time. Oh, yeah, that's actually really interesting. So, I think we can, let's just take a little side really quickly. How much labor time is getting put into your sweater? Ten minutes. Ten minutes. How long does it take for a sweater to get through the factory? Three weeks. Okay, so, think about the life of a sweater. It's going through the factory. They're going to get into a bin with 199 of these sweaters. Stay with yourself in the Shun sweater, think about it's life. It's sandwiched in this bin with 199 trends. And here's what happens to it. It gets brought over here, starts with Zach, and it sits there waiting for it's turned to shine. And then, you know, swiss with all its friends. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. And then I plopped into Zach's sewing machine. How much time do you spend with that, Zach? Six minutes for the meeting. Not even that, because we've got how many operations divide? Oh, yes, like, oh, man. Maybe it gets a minute of love hands on from Zach. I don't get sad. And then, Jenny, go back into the bin and then just wait. And then comes over here, waits in line, eventually corhane, holds the sweater out, gets a minute of love, goes back into the bin, and then goes on. Right? Ten minutes of three weeks is all that that thing actually gets value added done to it. The rest of the time, what's it doing, Diego? You didn't think? Just sit there. Just like, wait, so you can calculate, I don't even know if this is James. So you can do a second ratio. Call this like value added for a sandwich time or something like that. But ten minutes divided by whatever 15 times 480 is, it's like, it's a really small percentage of the time sitting in the factory. Sex can figure it out. It's like, 1%. Like, what percent of the time is it? The total length is 7200. So, yeah, like less than 1%. Less than 1% of the time sitting in the factory, is it getting value added done to it? This is a little bit of our articulation of like, this is an articulation in some way in how expensive this French worker is. We're going to figure out here just a second, just how expensive this is. Or just what this is. Diego calculates, there are 30,000 sweaters out there. How many pins does that? Somebody help us out. 30,000 divided by 2115, how many? Or 150. Okay, now, what Diego just did, whatever earned him the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in operations, if you'd come up with this in 1960. Because in 1961, Comrade G. Professor N. John Little came up with this mathematical relationship between, through one time, output rate, and what a working process it meant for. It seems a little bit trivial. If you're a chemical engineer, it's super trivial, because this is just a calculation of how much water is in the hose, how long it takes to get through the hose, and what's the flow rate of the hose. But, in this context, it helps us see the mathematical relationship between inventory, output rate, and our output time. Now, what's cool about this is, how many workers were there like you, Jake? 42. 42. So, back at the envelope, how many pins does each worker have sitting in front of them? About three. They're probably working on one bin, and they've got two lined up. So, when the min-to-potero handler is trying to figure out where to take this bin, they're looking around, and they're trying to keep these guys stacked up with at least two bins in front of them all the time. Carolyn, sorry, I did this to you. Why do we push so much inventory in front of all these people? Good question. Obviously, as we talked about before, they are expensive, and you want to utilize them to the nice capacity. This is like us keeping the delta of jet as occupied as we can. These are our expensive resource that we can't adjust easily, or stuck with them. And we're going to keep them crammed with inventory to make sure that they stay fed. Because the expensive thing is to take a French person that I can't fire, or send home. So, I'm sorry, we can't do this. We can't adjust this. So, I'm going to keep them fed with work. Because it's expensive not fed. They have another. Okay, cool. Diego, we can't call this a Diego law. So, this is called little flaw. Being that for a non-little, it pains me to admit this, but John Liddell is actually a marketing professor. If you knew that somebody in marketing could be in a contribution to operating this case, usually. Now, Diego, right before we talk about cells, let's just do something kind of. This is a conceptual question. What is it, how do we get the appropriate out of it? How do we decide the appropriate out of it? How do we get the forecast? Okay, what are we trying to forecast? We are trying to find the demand of the country maybe or your market. You want to produce the same amount. The same amount. Probably 2000 units per day. Ideally, it's what the market should be purchasing. If they're purchasing less than that, then we end up sending stuff to Ross or Carlos to buy. We do it under. We're going to upset our relationship with our buyers at Zax, the value, or whatever. So, we're trying to, that output rate is basically you should take, at least as operations people has given by the market. But maybe in print, not because you're a priori piece, maintain your group by the people. Well, that's fair. This is similar in Argentina maybe, if you want to steal, maintain your group by the people more, you are worried about the... And the most extreme articulation of this, and don't take any of this the wrong way. Historically, there are some really great examples of like economies where employment was the only goal. So, like in the former Soviet Union, if you're running like a glass factory, there's like some five-year plan that the premier says, this is how many tons of cheap glass we're going to be making for the next five years. Because the goal of a communist economy is just to keep people employed. Especially because these are the new gannis tors. Yeah, you can say exactly. That's a nice person. It's a good story to carry it over. But like, ideally in this situation, we're trying to match our team. Okay, so, here you go. And this is fixed because it comes from the market. And we think that throughput time is bad. It's bad because if we have like a year of throughput time, we have to make a guess on what people are going to be demanding. You know, our marketing people, our product people have to guess what sweater people are going to buy a year from now. And then to make a bet on how much they're going to buy a year from now. You set that in stone and start manufacturing. And then if you're wrong, you get over, it ends up at Ross, you get under, it ends up at Ross. If you can squeeze that throughput time down from a year down to a smaller number, you get to update on the fly. This is what Zara does. So Zara can take like a design of a piece of clothing and have it in store in like a week and a half. And then they can go, oh, some people actually don't like this thing. We thought they did. We can dial it down. Or people are really fine. A lot of this. We can dial it back up. So that's what throughput time allows us to be closer to customer man. How would we drive down throughput time given the output rate of fixed? Look at the equation. I'm at risk. Dan's going to ask me this question. I'm asking Diego right now. Diego, output rate is fixed. If I want to drive down throughput time, what could I do? Gorky says. What? Gorky says. Which is what? Because you. Yeah, but you're not. Best pair cells are going to help us. Generically what the cell is going to allow us to do. Because you are in your equation. You are in your equation. You are in the machine. The throughput time. I want to do this now. This is fixed. Diego, what could I do? One. Would you like one day? Okay. Jam, what do I do? I saw you doing something like this. I was just thinking with my hands. I should have done. But I don't know. If you have fixed, you'll lower it. Something with the whip. Something with the whip. Jam, what would you do with the whip? If you could squeeze, look at this. This is really interesting. If you could squeeze down from three bins down to like one bin, that means that every one of those little sweaters has a lower amount of time to wait. Does they go to the factory? If you could squeeze down worker processing in Tori, you could get through the time to go down. Which would allow you, you know, in business terms, you get closer to customer man and have your mistakes. Okay. Now, yes. So, to lower the whip, are we saying that's why we need to sell to people to basically get better forecasting? That's where that comes from. That's a great question. Okay. Let's not hang in there. We've got six or four minutes. Eight more minutes. So, what I'm saying here with Jero's equation is, think of these things as interrelated levers. I can't move the output rate lever because that comes from the customer to man. And I'm asking Diego, in this equation, this little machine grid, if I really want to lower through whip time, what else do I need to lower? Like, what's my lever? In the lever is to lower the working process in the J. And in lowering working process inventory and reducing throughput time, that would allow me to get closer in time to where customers are actually buying this stuff to see what they're doing to allow me not to over-underreduce and they get kind of closer to what we think they want. Is that fair? Yeah. So, I was just, I guess I was just curious, like, in application, but we can lower the... Let's come, let's come with... But, but here's the problem. Why do we have so much whip in front of these guys? We just said earlier, we got big bad sizes, but also... These guys are expensive. We want to keep them fed with stuff. So, we've got to find a solution to reduce whip that will also keep them fed with stuff to work on. That's where cells are going to come. So, let's take... Alex? There is a piece where you want to raise two for time, and it's going to have a good flow. Yeah. Yeah. Did you dig any? We're not having that. It's not going to be... Why? Why? To say more about that, I don't know if you meant it. So, I recall why. And often, why is that that has been fermented for a long time? I'm often longer. I often have more enhanced weight. And so, it might mean that you actually increase your whip by another factory that you can store more wine. Over the warehouse. Yeah, cool. I was just thinking luxury goods are out. You want to create a scarcity effect of like... Time waiting, I was just going to take a year to get to you. Yeah. And then we said we talked about mortgages. You got to wait for a mortgage at the bend. For a quick time on that, you want to be like... I really want this house. I don't want it to restrict some move. Can I get this thing on a rigid and lighty day? It seems like they're always waiting longer. I think I made sense of it by this thing. Oh, this is in this section. But, you know, I was sitting with some kids in our ward going to do mortgages in the pretemple one time. I think it might be like, I'm going to fish with your wrist. Or, I'm going to fish with this. It's actually like latency talent. You could put time in the pretzel. It's actually maybe not that. But you could imagine that we could figure our way to do temple ordinances more quickly. A lot of people do like five names. Take with them at a time. Or like reduce the length of an endowment session or something like that. You know, part of the value proposition there is you're getting people time to sit there and like bask in the lower spirit. Through what time there's actually a problem. Problems with them. Okay. Back to cells. Who here feel like they've got their head around the cells just a little bit that can help us get through this. Okay. Alex, what's on June? You guys are going to work with the two of you at Energy. Okay. How many workers are in a cell? Okay. We've got a little gray on that one. Just a little gray on that one. And we're going to arrange them kind of roughly in a semi-circle. More shoe. More shoe. More shoe. How do you say more shoe in French Stewart? I actually have a cross shoe. So, I'm going to have a foot. You guys study harder. So, and then how many machines are we going to have in a cell? Twelve. Twelve. So, we're going to have roughly speaking what's our machine utilization of this cell? It can actually course from 76%. This is the price of doing business here. Why do we have extra machines in this cell? Sometimes we're working process in three fields of it. Bad. All the employees are cross-claimed. Take your move and help. Yeah, but there's another reason to be it. The machine's very loud. Yeah, it's good. Good. Some of them are meant for special teams. Yeah, so, there's only like one K machine, you know, a factory that is like a surger for doing special followers with blah blah. Each cell needs to have that now because each cell is its own main factory. So, we're generally going to do a little bit worse on machine utilization itself. Okay. We have six workers about how many cells are they going to be? Seven. Seven. How do you get that? Okay. So, we have 42 workers over six workers per cell. And that's going to give us seven cells. Okay. Are we cool? So, we've been thinking of this chest board and divided it up into seven horseshoes. Now, how does work flow through the cell? So, they have one worker start on the birthdays and then they put in the inventory and then pass it along. They pass along one by one. So, the case actually tells us we've got how many bins per cell? Two. We've got basically like one and one bins per cell. Okay. Now, we're going to see two really cool things about this. In the previous administration, how long did it take when Zach, Zach sewing machine, I didn't tell you this, had the wrong color thread on his order. Sermaine, there's this traveler that goes with the order that says what's the process. It says there should be red thread on Zach's stage doing the buttonholes. Are we cool? How long does it take before Jorge can say? How would you say Stuart, Yo, Francois, you're using the wrong color thread? But you want the direct like Yo, like, if I was you. Okay. How many? No. No. How many? How many? That sweaters has Zach made for Jorge says that to Zach. No, it's not 200. It's like 600. No, is it normal? Normal? Monty, how many? Like, isn't it like? How many were in part four? 15,000. Well, no. Bad fans have it? No, you need that. There are three bins in part four, eight, wings. We think 600 bad sweaters before Jorge says, it's a little lower. What was in part two of that that Zach did not agree since it was not lost, created a poor point about stuff. They may not be exactly. Alex, it's on the other side. How many bad sweaters does Zach made for Jorge? That's 40 and that's that five or seven. No, not even that. Oh, I like one. How many sweaters bad sweaters does he made? Literally one sweater and then Jorge says, no, Zach, you did the wrong thing. So, self-tending better for quality because you can quickly back. If you guys are alluded to this, we're going to go over like two minutes. If somebody is highly sweaters ahead of them, we were making legos in class. I said you have to pass them along all the same time. But if we allow those, pile up in front of somebody, what do we get to do in this in a cell? Help. Somebody's going to go, oh, let me jump in and help you. My thing is going slower or faster. Year slower, I'm going to help with your backlog. So, it allows you to rebound once like really easily. It's really flexible. Okay, really quickly. So, how many bins of sweaters are there in the cell factory now? Two bins per cell times seven cells equals 14 bins. Check this out. Five things we're going to end up. This is as close as you're going to find to something getting a pre-lunch, getting something for nothing in business or in operation. We just took 150, we went down from what's 14 bins? How much? 2800. 2800. 2800. 2800. We're going from 30,000 down to 2800. We're keeping 2,000 the same, and that means our three, the case tells us the three per time is going to be around one day. So, we got this really cool, by the way, this is probably right here, as filled as estimate. We basically got something for nothing. We get to get closer to the customer. Our forecasting is easier. All we did was squeeze out a whole bunch of inventory money reconfiguring out. My favorite picture in the case that they all end on is, what's a picture with the dude with the socks? You see that? Yeah. You see what's one is that right here? Exhibit 11. My favorite picture. Look at the dude back in the back right there, kind of hidden. Wouldn't that know shirt? It's a French dude with no shirt. Why does that French dude have no shirt on? Why is it hot? It's the sock steamer. The sock steamer, probably like the temple, is a place where we actually want things to sit and wait for a while. We're putting socks into that steamer, and they have to sit there for a certain amount of time. So, we can't squeeze down throughput time in the sock steamer. That's an operation where we probably are not going to do cells. Because we don't actually want reduced throughput time. We got to leave them in there for a while. So, cells are really great for some things. They're not great for some other things. But because the right application allows us to really squeeze out the second, you better download the Portfish. Great job to you guys for also the next time we have... ...a good chocolate."
