  "text": "I'm going to ask you guys. No, first of all, first of all, first of all, first of all. Okay, but honestly, the reason I said is my, like, world you hear is it possible. You've got really good preparation and I've been still thinking of discussion where we don't want to be so. So, thanks. It's a good, it's a good, it's a good lesson. It's not a lot of work. It's not a lot of work. It's not a lot of work. It's not a lot of work. Yes, it's a hard work. So, if it's good, it's our fault. Yeah, if it's good, it's your fault, isn't it? Yeah. We're going to start with that one. Let's not go to front that time. Where are you guys? Eight decks. Oh, no. Yeah. Bye! We're going to go to the back. There you go. We're going to make it. My name's Arthag. Okay. Okay. Here's this stuff. Here's what we are. Uh... I don't know if we're going to do it. Look, this is just like notes. Three notes. Did you read a poll right today? No, what? Because you did it just... Okay, sorry. I was talking about one of my batteries. How sensitive. So, uh, here's the setup. I mentioned a couple times for this. So, we're kind of start out doing, like, basic fundamentals, like finger exercises. Learned play piano and over time we're going to rise now. And I want you to tell your attention to the way this case is going to be different from previous cases. So, generally speaking, when we've done the case, we've gotten like... We kind of keep down on figuring out what's wrong. Like, where's the bottleneck? Where are the problems? We haven't done a ton to do like what we actually do with that information. Last time we did a little bit. Like, what was the case for the last time? The cranberry. So, what was the thing that we said we could buy the dryer? So, we bought a dryer that turned out to be a little bit... So, that was a little bit of like how we would actually improve the process, or do we just diagnose it? We're going to spend a couple of sessions now talking about process improvement. Like, what do we do when we want to actually fix something? And this is... This is to me a really... An interesting... And there's that end up being actually maybe even some like spiritual connection to this. And I want to just like... Have you stopped and think about like the situation we're in here as managers? Who here... Who here could share like briefly an experience where you work in an organization or stuff just like a huge mess? Like, you just look... John, what else about it? There are a couple of things that head around by a client. It's a software company. It's a software company. It's a software company. So, there's like... There are many different data sources. And I think we can practically each other or nothing is aligned. We just... Anytime we're like... You know, we've got data that we have for this. Like, it just never existed or at this... So, kind of the way that we've been never figuring it out. What did this result in? Like, what was the... Like, this like higher-cost, again, make that stuff? Was it like... People leave, like, what were the outcomes of this? Yeah, we're definitely seeing a lot of that like churn from Professor Richard. I think that products were working together. So, the other issue was both the culture of the casting, like the... Basically, it didn't turn out the way it's seen in the past couple of years. I think that's a great sign. I think I'm really making sense. I think I'm trying to get this small company. It's like... You want to sign something? Something's going to arrive. You know what? So, I think that's a little bit more chaotic, but I was a quality manager at Amazon Film Center. So, we had like, anywhere at the awards, like, five million units in the warehouse. And I just made sure... Or my team tried to make sure that everything was actually where it was supposed to be. And then it did condition. And also, lots of different sources of truth that all differ, which makes it a good financial life. So, nice. How's... I worked at a big group of some offices. We showed... You also tell us, I was just going to show you a high-tech one. Almost by definition. Yeah, it's like 80% of the time. We didn't have the definition, we saw on the correct model, things of ART, they didn't know their cross-structured components. And things would work out as long as the market was heated. They wanted to go out of the earth like, hold on to the earth? Yeah, they'll be from our plants. That's terrible. You're like the priest getting last rights to... Most of them would be... Would it be interesting? What was that? Yeah, that actually was five-fourth bankruptcy and they had one of them. Okay, now, I want you to think about you and your careers. My perspective is that sometimes in the next couple of years, the reason you're in school is you're hoping to be put in charge of something like this. And it makes a ton of sense, like, to sit here in the ivory tower and pick apart other people's decisions. But it's actually pretty challenging to think about, because somebody who can't charge a pull-width today in this situation, like, what I do, there's like ten different levers you might plausibly pull. Yeah, this is like a dining technology. I got people working on the line who think that their artists, you probably are. I've got like a whole bunch of expenses around quality. I'm going to... There's all much stuff there. If I were like higher to come into this situation, like, what I work on first. And this is actually like... This happens at like pretty much every scale you can think of. Like, I don't know, anybody got a new church calling in the last year? Would you get called at say, high priest? High council. High council? What's the core job of a high councilor? I hope everybody... That does not reach out to me. This is interesting. Who else says he had an answer? Gordon, what did you get? What do you call the primary teacher? Probably, that's not all. Yeah. At least, in case it's real. You get put into a new job. And you have this... This like... The like, not the lemma. This challenge of figuring out like, where do I apply effort first? Like, how do I... I can understand stuff when you're right. You know, you probably have some metrics in the world you're assigned to. It's like... For the metrics, they ask you about a high councilor. So, like, people's mix, ordinance to be down. Like, covenant paths. Like, do you go talk to people individually? Do you go talk to the elders going present? Do you talk to the bishop? Do you talk to the... At least say like, what do you do? I mean, I'm about... ...to have weeks in it. I'm just... ...one of them else in the world. Oh, no. What's your... What's your major? What do you do in the world, primary? We can get them to pay attention for the ten minutes. What, levers do you have in your disposal? We use the ideas. Up to the beginning of the topic. That's a nice... ...stance. There you go. Have you resorted to stax yet? No. No. We use videos. We use pictures covering nice... ...nice. Are all the kids the same? No. Are you like triagey? Like, what's one you talk to an hour or something like you're going to do? Yeah. Yeah. What's the... Oh, we have some better, like, a little bit more of a spectrum of terms. Yeah. I don't know if you need to get some of that... ...there's a kid that brings something to just draw on all class. But yeah, I know. But yeah, I know. And you're trying to generate this thing where people feel a spirit... ...they'll go, yeah. ...and then, like, walk out of there, but, like, where do you start? This is actually really, to me, like, a... ...challenge problem that is, like, happens at any level... ...of anything that even looks for a multi-like leadership. They're... ...but it charges something, and you gotta figure out, like, how to make it, like, one better. And, you know, you get what it charges for, right? And we've got, like, a whole bunch of different things we do... ...for work on here. Yeah. Who knows which one is the right one? So we're going to talk about this project green light game. We'll try to get our heads around, like, how the business is running for four project green light. If we do our job well by the end, we'll get our heads around... ...how statistical process control works. You're not going to need... ...you're not going to need your left-lock sadly. Do you make your calculate all the different shifts of... ...exposite money? Oh, I didn't do all the shifts, but I did excel at... Awesome. That service is so great. It's going to be fun. It's so good. You're not going to need it here. Okay. Dang it! She has it right here. Oh my goodness gracious. This makes me so... ...I can't keep this. Yes. I'm so excited. You guys do this. So, that's what we're about today. Is trying to understand if you get to put in charge of something like this. What are we going to do about it? What point of entry we use to try to fix the problem? Okay. So, that's kind of big picture we're headed. I'm going to probably... ...this is my municipal map about what this looks like. The map is this perfectly, but... I think this is like three levels. So, like, out-level is... ...how do we fix the mess? In a messy situation. Down in the bottom we're going to be doing stuff like... ...an X-throw chart and R-throw chart. These are going to be tools. And there's going to be some like... ...conceptual middleware that will have it we're trying to get to. But we're... ...we're going to start here, take a drain down here, and then go back up. And our goal is to help steer his right foot. So... ...then... ...can I call a code color again? You never called call me. Yes! Okay. No, it's not that. It's still... This is a... ...maybe like a funny question. Then this particular situation, why is quality important? It's quality important. This question. A basic problem is... ...with sampling as they keep having to do something. No, no, that's like... ...like, take a bigger picture of you. Big picture. Why is quality matter to like the customer to do something? She don't want a product that's like not like... ...one of the problems was like, you hit the button, it doesn't come out or you hit the button. What is that? The thing says like, it doesn't work properly. What are people using these things? They're using these things probably often at parties or things. Use that now to capture moments. Yeah, capture moments. This is funny. This case, the journey of this case is like... ...the 2001 ever is like, that's enough cake. It was like originally before that. Old, too old. So like, everybody's what bullroids were then. And then like fell off and like, that's stupid. And then it's not artistic. And now I can't go to wedding reception now. And you can see like... ...that's always capable. Take a picture of yourself and put on the bullroid. I did that. I did that. I said, is what? You were the photographer. No, I was taking a picture. Santa, why wasn't I fighting? It was like, it was a long time ago. You guys are the same study group? Yeah. I went to her wedding, but I was like, I was like, what's her roommate? Whoa, that's crazy. Okay. Santa, what's your favorite? Can you look at that book? If you know what I can look at it? No, but I use a book. All of that. I do a lot of work. I can't handle it. That's why we're in a group now. We're working on it. No, we're working on our relationship. What do you suppose, Ben, are like moments people are using this book? They don't have cell phones, because they're like pictures. Like, what are people using this book? Where are they using this book? Probably a lot of different things, but I'm going to say parties, and the settings, those kinds of things. I can't handle them. I'm scratching them. Handle them. Yeah. Corbin, I say you kind of like, what do you... That baby picture... Baby picture? That's like everything, because you had an instrument. That's it. And it's hard to characterize this monetarily. You probably could if you were a smart marketing analyst. It's kind of class. What is the cost of the company when one of your customers takes a picture of their babies first smile? And then the thing comes out, and the finger height is too high. What happens if you finger height is too high? Oh, it doesn't. There are two different ones either. It doesn't develop. That's a pod weight. Oh, that's the pod weight. Of the finger height is too high. It either doesn't come out. Does anybody have ventures come out? Is it too low? Or do you get too... Two of them? Yeah. They're both bad. Pod weights too high. What happens? Then, I can't remember which one is too high or too low, but either it is underdeveloped. He's been those a lot about polaroids, so this is the only one. Or it's like, two big leaks. There's not enough reagents. No pinch. Okay. So that ends up being painful to the people who care about the customers. And you lose customers. You lose customers. Okay. Awesome. So, quality is a big deal here. Then, what is... What are we spending the quality right now? It's light. We're getting only $2.00 at least $19.00 for it. So, why? Three point subjects. Two points. That was not higher. That much, you wait? Yeah. Two eight million for what? Scrap. Scrap. Okay. What else, Ben? We're also hiring like 125. 125. It is white. It's so stupid. It is white. What else? What else? So, the 125 inspectors, the sample inspectors, the scrap, try to figure out how to... Got two different levels of quality control as well. You got the operators who find certain things. The auditors, the five others, the auditors. And then there's disagreement on what... What quality control metrics do you use as well? Okay. Think about what we're asking Ben. Right to be Ben. So, Ben said that stuff is important. If somebody needs to figure out sentence writing, and I've got to come out, then paint blue bad. You don't mind over it anymore. That's us. That's our customers. We're spending a ton of this. A... Lately... By the call company? Yes. Oh, sweet. So, it's your second? That's great. That's great. It's your second chance. It's your second chance. It's our number one chance. Great, the first time. Yes, you did. I got the first time. Thank you for your charity and not fully-prepared. Likely. This is going to be worse than you think. Like, conceptually big picture. If you had to describe like, for somebody outside that doesn't do any business, they don't know anything else is a successful process control. How would you like, analogize or like, describe their approach to quality? They're trying to keep bad stuff from getting to people. That's what it's called. Like, what is... Before Project Greenlight, like, how would you characterize their approach to making sure Mad Sun doesn't get out? I kind of put like the word I would use as a swamp-us. I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry. How do you spell it? I actually don't know how to spell it. You're at it. You want us to be? You want us? Sure. Okay. I like that keep going. Because the two different systems of quality control have the auditors who are doing their thing and then the operators who are doing their thing, but then they're like pulling it out and putting it back in. So that it's getting more... So we're talking about it. I really like that. What's the whole plan goal? To not have bad stuff come out. That have bad stuff come out. So if you had... I wanted to keep pushing on this. Again, it had characterized how it took... What you did, and this is very good, and it has to go very well. You kind of characterized how the system feels. How would you characterize what is their strategy to making sure that stuff doesn't get out that's bad for us? Like, what's their philosophical approach to problems? I guess the more we check, the more bad things. We'll catch what they get out of it. Oh, I like it a lot. Anybody else out there want to fill in on this? It feels like battleship. What's that mean? So, ship battleship. You're guessing and hoping you can find your enemy ship. In this case, the enemy ship is a bad carton. And what's interesting is that things the operators and the quality managers are playing battleship against each other. They're trying to make sure that the quality people don't find their stuff the thing that they're saying. And the quality people are trying to hit all the battleships that they can. Cool, cool page. I think they're ideally... They're all double checking their own everyone's work. So, I think when they're looking from a positive rose colored glasses, this is what we're trying to do. Everyone's trying to... We're just double checking, making sure. Right, like from what the goal is. Cool, cool. John? It's also a destructive audit system because they don't know how the more they check, the more light out of the next one. Yeah, destroyed because of it. So, it's like the strodinger's cat thing. What? They're going to kill the cat, I don't know. They're going to kill the cat, but they're going to take it. They're very reactive. They're not building in quality. They're hoping they catch things. Okay, so, I like where we're heading here. When you say reactive, what do you mean? They do even... They are trying to test quality and build it to their process. So, they check the quality of their manufacturing in the hopes that they can get it out all the poorly made ones. Okay, okay, likely, let's circle back to you. So, I like this kind of work, I think, we've built. Or we're kind of reacting to stuff. Double checking and going getting problems where they're going. What would the alternative be? Like a good alternative with the screen like me. How would you characterize that? Instead of checking all the time? Instead of checking and being reactive, like, what would we? Like, what's the goal of the screen? Yeah, to be more proactive. And what does that mean? That's a cool bit of a storm. Yeah, and instead of checking for things that are bad at the very end, let's put processes in place to make sure that they're good from the beginning. Oh, okay, this is awesome. So, this is like... Nice, thank you. This is like fine probs. Good, good. And if I can say it this way, like, filter them out. Versus build a process that doesn't make mistakes. To tolerate, but that's the two philosophical approaches. We could just let this thing run and catch stuff, or we can take a deep look at the process. That's what we're going to try to do with SBC here. So, what we've got to do to understand SBC is take a dive down to a lower level to understand some of the concepts here, and the math a little bit. But really, we're really focusing on trying to understand how we actually apply this stuff. Wait, to clarify, sorry. Are you saying, which one are you saying it is finding problems and building out versus building a process of this? This is the old... Oh, that feels like... And this is what we would like to do. This is like a deal. Like, it'd be really great if I may in Jake's job, to like... rather than just wait for statistics on like... How many people like went to an active in that war? It'd be really great if we could like get ahead of me. Like, what these people like wanting to distance themselves from the church? And like, what can we do to like get ahead of that so that we don't have to go... not have the worst of people that don't want to talk to us anymore? You really ready to figure out what people's pain points are and address some of these better jobs like before? Is that... That's way easier. It's hard to get set up, but then it's way easier than just working with them. Is that quick? Okay, so, uh, goodbye. One more thing, thank you very much. In terms of the case, if I'm understanding this quickly, the reactive mind problems, that's what you say their whole idea is of some of the volume of the serialization. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In fact, I would even put that way kind of a caliber of a skew on this thing that Blake said, which is like... Focusing on machine utilization is almost like a symptom of what's going on. It's a way to describe what's going on, but the core of it, like, that's how we generate some of the bad stuff, but the core of their philosophy is like, let's let all these people be independent artists, running their injection moldy machines, and we'll try to catch garbage. Yeah, that's crazy. Okay, uh, anybody here who likes artry? Really? Yeah. Okay, there. Perfect. What if I serve 100 percent? Or are we good? Are they really good? They're really good. Okay. Okay, dang. Okay, there. We have... We're going to go to an artry class. Did you take like an artry class in school or did you just fight? No, I just learned it. Okay, so we got two targets here. We got two people here teaching. Take evidence on them to go learn how to do artry. And here's the... Here's the two targets they should. Okay, set up, choose six arrows. It's going to be a lot of bad stuff. Well, I don't know if it's nice, but you miss. Okay, uh, and then, uh, Ammon shoots six... It's six arrows. One there. Perfect. What do you think of those two targets? So the left one's sentence is precise, but not centered. Um, and then Ammon's is neither. Whoa! I can't even stop. That's because it's so much better than Ammon's. I remember, uh, Cartesian coordinates in like six grade. And I'm going to stick up for Ammon. Yeah, thank you. Magical. Ammon's... Ammon's actually way better than Sam. Because on average, she's an executive rights one. Yeah, look at that. If you take the average arrows for a... Ah! I mean, if that's your goal, sure. Well, it's an issue. Can't you stand on the target? Well, if you didn't hit the side of the target. Well, you didn't hit the side of the target. He's... He's hanging on average. He's right. On average. Okay, uh, The little wins of the game is a goal. The insight here is what there's going to be on the next. Here, what's the prescription for Sam? That's a nice picture. I mean, in archery, there's a lot of... Yeah, but you walk over there and see that she's shooting very precise groups of arrows just in the wrong spot. What do you do? What's your prescription? Probably look at her, where she's aiming. Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah, however she's citing this in, she should be aiming in a different spot. That's pretty straightforward. Send her to me. What's your prescription for Anna? Actually before you said, what's the diagnosis? What's going wrong with Anna? Send us to aiming in the wrong spot. What's Anna? I'll try correct. I really don't know what Anna is. It's hard to be determined. It's like a gesture. No, here's the thing. He's actually right in a way that said, he's not average exactly. Right, he can hit the spots that he's probably aiming at, but he's maybe not aiming at the right spot. No, that's said. Send is not doing the right spot. He's on average exactly right, but it's all over the place. What's your diagnosis? Like for real, if we're doing archery and Anna gets shooting stuff all over the place? There's probably something wrong with this form or maybe the tools that he's using. Cool. So he's like, shaky, like he's aiming at the right spot. Is it a buzz to send something? It's a buzz. That's a negative buzz to heavy. It's a negative buzz. It's a negative buzz. It's a negative buzz. It's got no more arpeggio. Yeah, seriously. But he's like shaking around something to it. Okay, we're going to characterize these two states of affairs by saying that setup is, this is something maybe. She's accurate, but she's precise, but not accurate. Meaning, precision is a measure of the spread of this, the variance of those arrows. Actualcy is a measure of that average location. You actually need both. And it's the inverse. And it's accurate, but not the supers. These are measures of mean and variance. Cool. Okay. We developed a tool in the process building and using statistical process control charts. And we talked about it in the case. We're going to, for our discussion, just focus on the X-bar chart. We could, what's the other one, Eric? Do you remember the X-bar chart? The range chart. The range chart. Okay. So, the R-chart. We used to measure the variance here. And the X-bar chart is what we're going to use to measure average location. And we're going to just focus on the X-bar today. We mentioned R-butt, this person, time safe, we'll just be wrong. Again, these are things that we're going to use to help. That he knows what Santa and Emma are doing that's causing them to get results or not that they want them to be. Cool. Cool? Okay. I'm not trying to be a bully. But their wish was that means that other people are here. Like, there's something, there's some questions. No, we're actually. I'll just double check English. Are you feeling okay? It's possible that I'm, what's the last term? Eight years ago I was wrong, like, like, nine. They're calling out, like, I'm using them wrong. This is actually, you feel, they're good fun. Yes, for sure. But either of them be either they could just be, like, if that one wasn't X-chart, that was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, focus on what I just said here. Great. But the accuracy is, is, is mean location. And this is spreadedness. So you're saying if the X, like, if that wasn't X-chart, then it would be accurate enough. We're going to get, we're going to make, I'm going to say, the X-chart is going to help us characterize the average location. And the R-chart can help us characterize spreadedness. Okay. So we should probably construct for ourselves a bit chart. Jake, this is like, it's your day. We're excited. Jake, we're going to do project green light. And here's what we're going to try to do, where you can kind of low level. We're going to construct for ourselves an X-chart. Try to understand how this thing works. And then we'll try to rise up and down. Do you want to measure finger height or pod weight? Finger height. Finger height. Okay. How many, no, no, we're going to do this. How many, how many are we going to measure? For example. I think this is a, I think it's the data set. The data set for the whole set. Yeah. Okay. Is that a good measure? I think it's the right measure. She was holding it in the back chart. This is fine. There's a couple. Michael, let's say that. Oh, I can sense it. We're taking some of the, we're taking some of the, they can use the terminal rule right here. A sample of the means like multiple fingers. The way things take the Zonig here, that setting used to make her cool chart, it's simple. One finger or a sample to the bigger. Do you know like not all those fingers in the same set? It's okay. So we're going to, we're going to pull up six pods and measure the finger height. Is that cool? Okay. So that is going to be, finger height. And once again we said, then once the problem is higher, a little higher, either it doesn't come out. No feed or don't. Okay. Cool. First sample, let's take the six, six of them. What are they? All right. Two point points. One point five eight. One point four nine. Two point nine five nine. Two point nine seven. One point eight seven five. Okay. Those are our finger heights. We literally, you know, head or operator on the line, full of the dot. Where do you get us number four? I should be going, this is just the first one. It's number one. Okay. Twenty to the joint. So I'm going to the calculator, help us make it here. How do you calculate the range of this? This is like, we're going to measure the precision of this. Okay. So back, what's back here? Back, back. And what's the minimum? This one. Which is, second, last one should be two point one zero seven. Thank you. So this action should be two point one five eight. See? So then, that was wrong. One's in for the first time in eight years. Monty Kotick. Would you wife agree with that assessment, by the way? Well, we're not talking about that. So, somebody should check that. What is that? What is it? Three. Three. Three. So that's the range we put on our chart. That'd be cool. We're going to focus on the average right now. So what's the average? Somebody else out? Two point two eight. Two point two eight. Okay. Now it's going to get fun. Jake. We got a couple of lines we got to draw here for our next chart. Which one's dashed? Is the middle one of the answer? Yeah. So, here's what we're going to do. Is it going to be our x-ball chart? We're going to draw a couple of lines. Jake. And then, Jake, uh, two point two eight. This is a, I'm going to put, uh, here. This is, uh, sample one. This is the first sample. Okay, we're going to put a lot of that chart. Okay, one of those, uh, school. School? Anyway, we have worries about this right now. Jake, one of those three lines. Uh, so you get your x-ball. This one? Uh-uh. Okay. And then, you get here, I'm going to try to run the lower and upper control line. You got it, actually, that's it. So, this is the lower control limit. And this is the upper control limit. Cool? What's that for? What's that for? What's that for? A ball? A ball? No, no, no. Hang on to that. Just a little while. Just a little while. Okay. Then, we go farther along the there. Or next day, Jake, you're going to do it. Okay, uh, pulls out another group of six. Same, we'll six, I call it. It does the same measurement. And that one is... Cool? Next day, here. And then, the next day, something happens. Yeah, right now. Uh, this fourth sample is above the upper control line. I know that's actually true on Santa's chart, but I'm going to just play along. Okay. Sorry, I have a question. The X bar, I thought that was, is that the average of all the averages? Or X double? That's a great question. I guess I'm a little... So, in stats, we would say that those are all X's. Right. And then the average, so, X bar is that. Okay. That X bar is the same way. Okay, and so X on our graph is 2.0 to it. Yep. Okay. Well, I thought X double bar was the mean of all means. If I had different, there would be the mean of... Yeah, that's... that's... Yeah, I just drew that there. Oh, so you... that wasn't the 2.08, because that should be another... Correct. That's why I was... Corbin, I was like, Corbin, whatever, it's cool. I'm not going to say, the average of the sample averages is the X bar bar. And that's... And I don't know where that 2.08 was above the lower. That's why it's... Someone announced it, I guess. Is that... So X1 is 2.0 to it. Correct. Okay, that's... Yeah, the cool. Okay. How to... Cool? Cool. Okay. Alright. But this is... Is it the X bar of the goal? Right, so we're... Okay, we're wrestling with deep existential issues here. They're more male. This is actually... What? Get out! Corbin! James is... Word, I'm going to throw a marker. By the way, I did... prayerfully consider this morning... Coming out with markers... And doing that like, Ammon, Senna, I think. But I wanted to do that. Yeah, it wasn't... The reason I said not to is that I just think it was going to secure stuff and it wasn't going to work. Way better than the next time. Could have brought my bow. Sweet. Corbin, I'm going to slightly alter the question that you asked. Could you, in a sentence, correctly characterize for us what it means when X4 falls above the upper control limit? What would you say is the state of affairs? Like, what would you explain... What would you say is happen? Okay, everybody listen really carefully. Put on your JDMBA hats and listen, dig a pit for your brother with his words. And listen very carefully to what he says. I guess I would just think that it would be out of tolerance or out of the limit that he said with quality. Okay, so this is really good. I really like this a lot. It's wrong. But I like what you just said. It's a really important way. I'm really, really good. These are... First-stage fan blades. I'm a 747. I like the red one, I like the cool one. So, like, I got like 30 something of these all rare. Single crystal taking them. The fancy expensive ones. Is anybody here having a big, like, anxiety of a flying? Okay, good. So, here's the deal. This way, let's say like 10 kilograms. If you put these two blades in the front of the bridge, there's like the round thing that goes to the spinner. And then this goes, you see this is like a plane. This way, like, 20 kilograms, 10 kilograms. If you're like a poxy, a penny right there on this one, and then fire the engine up, it will like, rattle the engine to death, and it will blow up. So, a little tiny, little tiny variance in weight between these fan blades on both sides of the first-stage chair, resulting in a terrible vibration of law. Why did I say that? Hold on. I'll just get still. Okay, here's what we would call... This is what we're really contextualized, what Corbin just said. The private way being, they know that the right weight for that thing is 20 kilograms. And what they say is, the engineers tell them is that as long as... So, this is the specification. And we would be willing to tolerate plus or minus, let's say it's like 201 grams or 1 gram. 1.1 gram. If we weigh no more than... ...my thousand... ...point 1 grams or 19, maybe... ...9 grams. So, I'll force you to buy a cheese look, why not? As long as we're inside of those tolerances, tolerances are what we're willing to tolerate that are departure from the specification. We're going to be okay. And by the way, if you do have the anxiety of a plane, but we're remarkable about this, is they never pop. Like, it's noteworthy in the news when, you know, Alaska Airlines has an engine blow-up. Like, it happens once every millions and millions and millions of seat miles. Everyone's on one of those pups and usually it's not fatal. The engine pops and then they got to go land seat-ups. So, it's like, we're markedly rare that we have a fan blade that ends up in an engine on the air-lighter that's out of tolerance. And blackout and woke up when I was talking about airplane engines. Corbin. Corbin incorrectly says that thing right there. I was actually thinking about like, like, the broad shots. Do they, do they back those like, they do a baseball? Yeah, you can see it. It's pretty cool. Corbin said, Corbin, what are you saying? I said, what does it mean when X, X4 is above? He said, it's out of tolerance, 4, he said it's an ounce out of... I don't know. How does the best space not fall? Okay. What's wrong with what he said? What's wrong with what he said, man? First, that's an average. Okay, that's fair. So, there's actually, if you've looked inside of these things, it looks like this. There's a couple of values in there. So, yeah, that's fair. Darling? All are ready to serve as their internals by... Okay, this is really important. Listen carefully. Darling's gonna say something that's really important to you. It's actually gonna be dissatisfied. But it's gonna be correct. Okay. It's always determined by you could say the customer or the company. What do customers want from their airplane engines? They want it very, very, very, very, very... They don't want them to boast. The engineers can lay that back into the organization. That's where those companies... The intelligence company, the customer, with upper control and lower control, that's come from statistical analysis of the sample you're taking into the curve. Okay, that's dissatisfying to me, because kind of what you just said, Corbin, where did upper and lower control limits come from? From the company. Down, that's not what down said. From the customer? No. Where did upper... You're gonna give you a little hint. This is three standard deviations. Above the three standard deviations, low things, three sigma, where did those come from? They're sample. They're sample data. Lundi? So the key difference here being tolerance versus control when that control when that goes all up, the numbers that are resulting from what you're doing. Okay. The tolerance is what you're aiming for. Corbin. So this is actually very dissatisfying. What did Monji just say? Where did upper and lower control limits come from? Statistics. Yes, but not like, you know, Cheney Reese. Where did they actually... Like, how do we get that particular level of life? Where did they come from? From the first sample. From the first sample. From the first sample. This is great. So we took all of the centers... Okay, have your chart. We took all of the centers observations. You all could have done this. Highlight all of those things. No, don't know how to highlight them. The next blank cell. And put equals... OpenPrin. No, equals to Dev. OpenPrin. Open all of those things. ClosePrin. Standard deviation of that. It's going to tell you what that is. And we can also just then calculate three standard deviations. It's going to tell you what that is. Corbin. This is existentially challenging to me. Correct. Can I just characterize this by insulting all of y'all's generation? Yes. Love it. Those lines are not based on something objective, like engineering, specifications or tolerances. These are basically... That machine's truth that day. You're so proud of yourself. And it's probably the thing that's going to be the end of the world. That y'all's generation defines truth locally rather than globally. But that's okay. You'll save it in some other important way. This is just... Corbin. Corbin, this is dissatisfied to me because we spent all this time calculating this. I set this up by saying, if you inherit this company and you get put in as the boss, the MBA, which levers are you going to pull? And what we just said is that Polaroid is implementing this project, Greenlight Project. And all this really gets them is, hey machine, like what's your truth? And how are you doing relative to your own truth like today? That's really sucks. Yeah, so Corbin, why would we do that? I don't know why I pick it on you. Why would we... What would be the utility in asking a machine? This is basically what Dallin said. Those lines are not based on anything objective. All they're saying is, machine, how are you doing today relative to how you've done in the recent past? Because we recalculate those upper and lower control limits like probably over a couple weeks. Like a trailing two week data. That's where we... So highlight those things, do equals 3 sigma, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's how we get those things. It's completely internally referential, not connected to anything that's reality or objective truth. Jared. We're measuring variants of the machine. I don't know, we're measuring accuracy here. The average finger height is what we're measuring. We're thinking of an excel that. Right, but if we're seeing the average go up and down, everybody got any day that we're seeing a larger variance in how the machine is actually. Okay, now this is interesting. What does that tell you? Because it's not connected to objective reality, which is the frustrating thing for me and Corbin and Down right now. Like Corbin said, if it falls outside, then it's outside of tolerances. I'm saying no, it's not. All it is is it's just... It's just kind of sucks relative to how it's operating in the recent past. Right, but that could matter depending on what your actual tolerance level is. Let's keep tolerances completely out of this. How could it be important for us? I mean, in any business, any circumstance you want to be consistency. And so if you're seeing that your machine is inconsistent, then you want to bring it back. Okay, let's just consist. So this is interesting. We're going to call this... We've got X bar, and we have N-variances. These are like statistical constructs, mathematical constructs. Here, we're going to like move up one level of abstraction. And if I may say that like restate what George has said, George said that there might be some utility in actually just measuring a machine's consistency, not relative to anything objective, but like how it's been doing in the recent past. Why would you want to do that? I guess if I can assume that it's doing things the correct way, I want it to be consistent. The correct implies some larger system of truth that you're... And that's not this. This is like... Oh, we're asking is like set aside, you know, God's laws of morality and inheritance, everything. How are you feeling today, relative to how stuff has been going in the last couple of weeks? Jen, why would we ask that? Well, I guess I was just thinking because the more data that you have, even if there is variance, is going to get you closer to the truth if that makes sense to Ali. So we're feeling different every day. I like what it means. It means different days and different moods and whatnot. You get an idea of kind of who we are. I like this, but you're still... Your state is still relies on some like outside specification. And I'm asking with no outside specification, like why might you want to do this, Joseph? Something's off. I remember in the book, it gave you an example of like a chef. Okay, all of a sudden temperature goes up. Can we figure out if there's anything else that happened? Oh, that's one of the half-shops. Cool. It's just like an internal diagnostic. Let me ask really quickly, could somebody change Corbin's sentence to be correct? Corbin said, this indicates that something is like our tolerance. Is that what you said? What would be the correct thing to say, given our reading, that change? Something year-round. Okay, that's what I like. Keep going. There's actually some important looking for us in the reading. Yes, there. That's the troll. So here's what we would say is a process is in control. And this is a very modest assertion. It's like internally referential. It's just in control and no sample averages fall outside upper and lower control limits. And then there's a couple of other things like taking a row, whatever. All this says, and just listen to this. The only thing this says is if we see a sample average outside of what we've normally seen, it tells us that something might be going differently today from how it's gone on the path. Again, not even towards some goal. All it's saying is we're being inconsistent here while we're not even done. Statistically, what we're saying is, is we're looking at this thing from the side. Because we did sample averages, Alex, we took six. We've got enough numbers that the central limit theorem is going to hold. And we're going to expect those sample averages to line up nicely and something that looks like a normal distribution and we can get tables to calculate something. All this says is, with a normal distribution, 99.7% of sample averages should fall inside of those control limits. That's just the definition of plus or minus 36. So it's a really rare occasion that we would see something fall outside. If something's working, going sideways, different from how it's done to the task. All we can say is, is how do people? Jen, what was your question? No, it was like, so it's basically 99.7%. That was 99.7% of sample. I was kid, a parent said, then, their nerds, they met in the ordinary differential equations class. My mom would sometimes jokingly say, for that joke, I think she'd make some serious play. And he's like a three-sigma kid. And my dad would say, is that three-sigma is above or below? That's right, exactly, that's good. Okay, yeah. That's cool. That's a good question. The core of it's been making to put tolerances and customer specifications onto this. And I just want to recognize what we've done in thus far. So we're going to use a new technology today, a red marker. And we could put customer specifications on this and say, this is 20 kilogram, or this is, you know, whatever it is. And this is the finger height. If the finger height is within those tolerances, we can get a single feed. It's going to work well with some big digital babies for a smile. But we haven't done that yet. Here's a way to sort of think about what we've done this far. And it's not just this nihilistic, genzy, my own truth is my own truth thing. What we've done here is actually something that maybe also has a kind of genzy issue, which is... You guys millennials are genzy. Most millennials don't want to come. I don't know what. What's the cutoff? I don't know. You don't need that. I'm trying to work in our game. All I know is you're going to call my kid a millennial student. Well, she's not. Oh, she's not. No, wait. That's just... Okay, here's the deal. Here's what we've done. Sorry for the coldness. We've walked into the situation where stuff is going sideways. You know, they have lots of garbage. And we're trying to spend a lot of money trying to paint sure the garbage doesn't happen. And what we've essentially said is, hey, a machine and person process. Nobody's ever actually like sat down with you and given you a voice. It's like, how would you do? I'm not really worried about how you're doing relative to some like make standard. I'm just like interested in how you're doing relative to how you've done the mask. That's essential. So what we've done here is we started by asking the process how it's doing. We've given the process a voice. I'm going to say the voice of the process is kind of a concept here in the middle where we've just said this. And the cool thing about this is even irrespective of what our tolerances are. Once we have this, we can look at that and go, holy cow, it looks like every C-shift something goes wrong. Relative to how it's done in the past. Or, you know, first day of the week, it looks like things go out of control relative to how they've gone in the past. It doesn't necessarily tell us whether it's going to cause a double feed or a no feed. But it gives us, it gives the machine and the operator of the machine a way to tell us how they're doing relative to how they've done in the past. And that way it's kind of beautiful. I've been critical saying it's millennial and post-truth and whatever. But really what we're doing is we're giving this thing away to talk and talk for Christmas. Cool. What would we call down? So you got to draw a line. What would we call it if we had, we paced it on your customer specifications and then we saw something that was apple-pick. Outside of those customer specifications, it's still not out of control. But it's outside of those customer specifications. What would we call that? I would call it out of tolerance, but I mean it's all. It was really close. We're going to use a specific term here instead of tolerance. Do you remember what it is when we were reading? We did that. The process is not capable. Okay. So this is a process is capable in product, wall, inside customer specs. What's wrong? That's in your, it's in your reading. These are two different constructs. I spent a lot of time like hammering this, but capability gets it. What corbino is referring to at the very beginning when I asked this question. We'd say a process is capable if it turns out products that are within what the customers ask and what. They are what we would call orthogonal concepts. These are two different things on two different dimensions. But the customer wants a little process. Now we can have some fun putting them together. And what I'd like to do is put these together for the next couple of minutes. And we're doing a really good job with this. And we can circle back and spend like four minutes explaining what a six-signal is. Because we now have the tools to understand what a six-signal is. At least don't mind just this. Okay. Let's think about, you know what? This is an MBA program. We're going to make two by two matrix. That's pretty exciting. So our two by two matrix, we're going to have an axis that asks whether this process is in control. And the y-axis will ask whether the process is capable. And we'll do yes and no. And then we're going to draw some charts to help us understand what this means. And the places start might be not one of the easy diagonals, but like... Who feels like they could tell us what a chart will look like with red and black? Then it's in control, but it's not capable. What would that look like? I'll start drawing. What would it look like to have a chart that's in control but not capable of money? Essentially you would have like your... When it's that you're setting or saving that you credit it into the first-class legislation, it's outside of those. But it still would take your UCL and obviously not capable. Okay. So here's the deal. We are operating consistently relative to how we've operated over the last couple of weeks. Nothing is going strange. But we are messing up our customers because that cartridge and that cartridge did double-peak. Can you think of an example from history or from life of something that looks that's in control but not capable? Zack says, oh jeez, I was going to say I have a jump-to-shark thing that you just took off the table. How are you in control but not capable? It's mostly a joke, but it would be like, I'm in control of my life. Well, relative to what? Relative to what are they doing? Yeah, so it's just kind of stumbling along as you have in the past but... But I'm not capable of getting this job or whatever it means. Okay. Okay, you see that? This is I think the US auto industry in 1978 when General Motors was making a ton of money. I know it's a long time ago. Ford has made a ton of money. They thought they were amazing. Generally speaking, when you buy a Chevrolet, you can take it home. You can take it back to the dealer and they would fix all the problems you've done in the first week. And then a car that generally speaking was pretty consistent. They would last like 60,000 miles. What happened in 1978 that changed? So, a different competitor came along and Toyota and Honda and the Docks and came along and re-drew customer expectations. Like when you bought Toyota, it turned out you didn't have to take back the dealer for a week. So the last like 300,000 miles, they never broke down. And that caused customers to be like, oh wait, I want this. GM was like, dumb and happy. I'm doing just fine. I'm going to have to have done the past. It's all good. You didn't realize that you were like a different model. That's the risk. That's the risk. You're feeling fine yourself in your post-truth world. But it turns out that the world around you is demanding more of you than you thought. Okay, cool. Easy to go. Think and control and capable here. It's like all my stuff is inside the control limits. And my customers are like around here. That's cool. Like we're happy there. Happy. It's all good. This one would look like we are... Look at this. This is kind of cool actually. We are out of control. Where did I drop my customer specifications on this one? Hey, what's this? You're out of stock. Yeah, how do you see that happen? We have low expectations. Customers are very permissive to the point that even if stuff is going awry, it doesn't matter. Yeah, much just. One big question on this. You do also have it as if your prior to customer expectations are just up to... Yeah, they could all be... I'd rather than center, they don't have to be center. Yeah, they certainly have to be the... Totally. Yeah, totally agree. Yeah. Directly, I'm gonna... This to me is... This is like deep and maybe a little bit like... I hope it's not like triggering anybody. This to me is like my good friends and family members that have been like... super high-funch functioning addicts. It's like stuff's going bad in their life. Like stuff like out of control, but they figure out ways to basically like... not bump into what their boss sees or what their family sees or like... like society's expectations. That's a bad situation because eventually that is gonna go awry. But it's good. The folks there are like... There's lots of good, like examples of this in... You know, this is probably... General Motors, it's a different time. Like things were going awry inside. Their customers were really doing this and that was fine. The no-no one is just a dumb survivor. And I don't know what that is. This is like us... You know, trying to... do some of the capital... I don't know. Thinking our crappy process and trying to make like space parts. Like it's not going to be. Okay. So why do we... Why do I go down this rabbit hole and do two like two? And let's zoom back to our question. Like you get put in charge of this place, put your approach. SPC is one of the approaches. And I want to just point out what we've kind of done... Conceptually here. I'll make second box bigger. SPC, we start with voice of the process. We just said, hey machine, how are you doing relative time? You've done in the recent past. And that gives us a way to diagnose what's going on in the ship A, B, and C. It's there, certainly gives us a baseline for like measuring, like, and then we would go out and say, what does the customer tell us they want? We've got to get our house in order before we go and figure out what the actual customer is asking for. And that gives us a way to like, come through all of the issues that you might come through in a new job. Do I start with people? Do I start with machines? Do I start with the customer? Do I start with SPC to say, hey, there's lots of swirling things here. Let's baseline and characterize this process. So understand how it's doing, we're all looking at what's done. And then we can start to later in these other things. Six sigma that you've all heard. Like, favorite, six sigma. You guys are getting, you guys are young to remember a 30 rock for a show. No, 30 rock for a show. You watch it, you watch it right now? Yeah. Have you seen the one on six sigma? It was like, I still said it wasn't. Yeah, there is so, how it follows is like NBC executive and NBC is part of like, general electric stuff and shining earthquake company. Very top here, so. Exactly. Outfall, it walks into like, it's like an SNL writer's room like, comedy writers. He's like, hey, we're going to start with six sigma. Like, because we as a company do six sigma. Like, that's, that's pretty fun. Like, why is that a funny joke? Why is that a funny joke? The process is a line of the type of work. I like that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah. Why is it a funny joke to think about measuring like tolerance is with like joke writing? James says, if you're comedian, appoint this to be out of the talk. The whole point is to be an outlier and weird. Like, that's like the whole process we build in the like, the company writers room and 30 rock for a set of cells. Like, you know, a whole bunch of people bring in their crazy stuff and you spend a week like, those are going to have to find the stuff that's like way outside of the whole world. Like, that's kind of what they do. So, like, that's funny. Oh, oh. Sorry. No, man, it's man of the fight. Because they're making a joke about the joke. It's like, not the joke. Thank you. Here's how six sigma works. You start with the voice of the customer. You say, hey, customer. Let me ask you this. What are you looking for in an airplane engine? I don't want to explode. And then we're going to take our engineers and translate that back into a specification. Inge ears, you're really good at calculating stuff. You know the like tensile strength of titanium, ray, or whatever. And you know what the speeds and the temperatures are here. What's the, like, how do we translate not blowing up into something that like the customer, that we understand. And they say, this, they say, let's make this red. That's our specification. This is, so, six sigma, it starts with number one, the voice of what? What would you start with here? I'm going to start with the voice of the customer. And that's those red lines. And then what we try to do is go and build a process that is so precise, and it's not just a three sigma event, but it's a six sigma event, which equates to like one and a half. And then you start with the same thing. The same thing is the same thing. This is the same thing. This is the same thing. It becomes like one and a million of them for us to generate and like falls outside of that. And the outside of the customer specification. So it's like almost never happens. In fact, you know, if you look at Dalin back in the Amazon warehouse, you know, one and a million packages going to the wrong place. They still paint, because you can't get it out of the news. You send a, you know, Dalin ring to somebody that's expecting toilet paper and my shorts. Like that, that's why a place like Amazon will use this. And that's why a place like, correct when you're generally electrically used to six sigma, you start with the specification. And then in the last minute, I'll just say, you can kind of almost think of these things as like different religions. So you did quick and like characterization of theology and moral religions. Generally speaking, in my view, religions are a way to say, here's what some higher being, their view of reality is. And then the whole like Sunday school lessons and all those different religions is like, what do you do when you don't measure up or what's your perspective be on like what God says is like true, right? SBC is a religion. And in this religion, it says, we're going to start with a cow, we feel. And then we're going to get into like one of the customer things. And what do we do when there's a departure? We diagnose that with the scratch. Six sigma is its own religion where they just say, but we're going to start with that stuff. And then the whole, all the Sunday school lessons in six sigma are built around if we see something fall outside of specifications or something in close to violence and specifications, what do we do about it? Like how do we repent? How do we fix it if we see that departure? So in that respect, they're kind of similar philosophically. We just look at your in which we do this. So you're saying that if it's within the first three, you have like a different process for addressing it. And then there's the next one. Maybe there's a page on Gardner's class. It's an amazing elective on quality. No, by far about six sigma. But basically they characterize the way I would characterize different kinds of sin, talking to my kids. They're going to characterize different kinds of sin, is it for petrature? Is it for repeated sin? Is it for the serious one? Is it for x, y, and z? And then all of their stuff is built around how do you approach the situation? What's the meaning of that? Okay. You guys are awesome today. Get ready for anything in there. Next slide. Thank you."
